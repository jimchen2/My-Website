Being a person like [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) is too
much for me. For instance, I need to use like phones, or else I will
have difficulty surviving in this world nowadays.

But anyways, I decided to take a small step towards Open Source &
Security.

## How?

So basically almost all my applications on computer(archlinux) is open
source now, I made this switch.

Google Chrome -\> Chromium\
VS Code -\> OSS Code\
Google -\> DuckDuckGo\
YouTube -\> Invidious\
MSOffice-\>LibreOffice/Google Docs

## Crappy Social Media

Then I decided to almost completely stop using Twitter, Reddit, Discord,
Telegram. The reason is that there are no healthy things on Twitter, and
no knowledge on all of them. Twitter is just a toxic and malicious area
filled with adult content and nothing useful. Similarly Reddit and
Telegram are filled with adult content, addictive and toxic, very
unhealthy and full of garbage. Discord is boring and full of gaming,
like full of rubbish. The only reason I am still using Instagram is
because some people I follow are on Instagram, but then I decided to
only use Instagram on my phone, since I think it is more of a phone app.
Social media is just bad for me.

## Things with no Alternatives

Gmail has no alternative since it is the Berkeley mail and I must use
that.

Some very crappy Chinese software cannot be replaced after I go back to
China.
