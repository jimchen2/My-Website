## What is it?

I am addicted to gaming. I hate to admit it but I was, and I am still
very much addicted.

## What games am I addicted to?

I consider my preference for gaming strange. I do not like the
mainstream games like Clash Royale or Honor of Kings which my classmates
play. Instead, here is a list of games I remember being addicted to
(from time order)

-   **plants vs zombies** 2nd grade-4th grade
-   **plants vs zombies 2** 4th grade-7th grade, sophomore year
-   **plants vs zombies ol** 3rd grade-8th grade
-   **carrot fantasy**\
    3rd grade-7th grade
-   **carrot fantasy 2 (and the variation in 4399)** 3rd grade-7th grade
-   **generals.io** 10th grade-freshman year
-   **zombsroyale.io** sophomore year-now
-   **brawl stars, slither.io** not too addicted

## Measures I have taken to prevent myself from gaming

I have taken multiple measures to prevent myself from gaming, with some
success and failure.

-   Before 6th grade I didn\'t remember taking any measures myself.
-   In 6th grade I was addicted to plants vs zombies ol, and in the
    second semester I told myself that every time I play I would write
    it on a notebook. In the end I controlled it.
-   In 7th grade first semester I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2
    and carrot fantasy, and I wanted to stop gaming. One day I played
    carrot fantasy 8 hours. Shortly after, I deleted carrot fantasy.
    Then I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2, after about a month, I
    deleted plants vs zombies 2. Then I downloaded plants vs zombies 2
    and was very much addicted again, then I deleted plants vs zombies 2
    a second time. Then I started playing plants vs zombies ol, and
    couldn\'t stop playing it.
-   In 8th grade I told myself I must stop gaming. In November I decided
    gaming is not meaningful. It was painful and in the second semester
    I remembered trying so hard. I tried to shift my attention to long
    walks and outdoor activities. In the second semester I played
    roughly once or twice a week, or once two weeks. In the summer I
    played less afer shifting my attention completely to outdoor
    activities.
-   In 9th grade I made an honest effort to stop gaming altogether. I
    played only once in September 13rd the first semester. In the second
    semester covid came. I liked going outdoors so much at that time
    that even during covid I was out walking 2 hours every day. I played
    less than 5 times the second semester, only before exams when I felt
    too much pressure.
-   In 10th grade first semester, I wasn\'t too much into gaming
    anymore. However, later that semester I suffered great
    disappointment, since I tried really hard studying(the hardest I
    ever tried so far as I could remember), but still got a really low
    score. As a result, I began to feel depression and became easily
    irritated. In the second semester, I began to play generals.io
    sometimes, like about twice a week.
-   In Freshman year first semester, all people in my dorm was so
    addicted to gaming, to the point I felt sick and hated the dorm. I
    hated school very much but couldn\'t do anything since I live far
    from my parents. I played generals.io sometimes, like less than 1
    hour a day. In the C Programming course I coded generals.io single
    player in C language myself. I couldn\'t do anything to stop it, but
    it wasn\'t that serious at that time. I distinctly remember in
    Janurary 1st 2022 I was playing generals.io as the clock turned. In
    the second semester, however, I grew more frustrated and hated the
    dorm even more, to the point where I suffered great emotional
    distress. I tried to control gaming by writing on my notebook before
    using computer, that \"this time I use computer only for \*\*\*
    purpose, not for gaming\". I checked my computer time usage every
    week. In the end I played for some time but it was under control.
-   In Sophomore year I decided to end it for all. However, everything
    just got worse. I wrote an essay myself on why gaming is bad,
    listing all pros and cons. However, it all got worse when I began
    playing zombsroyale.io. It all started when I accidentally came
    across the game one afternoon and couldn\'t stop playing for 2 hours
    straight. In the first semester there was massive covid lockdowns,
    and I felt bored and depressed being locked down, and couldn\'t
    control myself from playing zombsroyale anymore. In the second
    semester I got on the exchange program to UC Berkeley. Then things
    got even worse. In the US, I was very lonely and unmotivated, and I
    completely lost control of playing zombsroyale. I played for more
    than 600 hours this year. I did try to stop playing, without any
    success. In October I stopped gaming for a week straight, motivated
    to do work when the school was locked down, destroying my
    motivation. In April I faced a challenging project, and started
    procrastinating, playing zombsroyale nearly all day long. I ended up
    cheating in that project. In May I decided to end gaming, and
    succeeded for a week. However, in June I was caught for the previous
    cheating, and I got very sad and fully embarrassed of myself,
    pulling myself back into emotional distress I suffered for long. In
    early August I felt completely out of motivation and dropped one of
    the summer classes, playing zombsroyale all day long for a week.
    Then I decided to stop gaming once and for all, but in the test I
    got really low scores, making me disappointed once again and lost
    motivation. Then in late August I tried to stop gaming by disabling
    zombsroyale /etc/hosts, rewriting the /etc/hosts every few seconds
    in systemctl service, and dropping the ip address of zombsroyale in
    iptables. However, the stress I faced with the coming semester was
    too huge, and I couldn\'t handle everything. As a result, I flushed
    the iptable, and manually changed /etc/hosts file and went back to
    gaming again.

## Why can\'t I stop gaming?

I did manage to stop gaming a few periods in my life successfully.
However, every time I was pulled back into gaming by emotional distress
caused by real life problems.

-   **Escape Mechanism** : Gaming provides an escape from reality. When
    faced with overwhelming stress, uncertainties, or disappointments,
    the virtual world offers a realm where I feel in control,
    accomplished, and momentarily free from real-life challenges.

-   **Dopamine Release**: The design of many games taps into our
    brain\'s reward system. Completing a level, defeating an opponent,
    or achieving a high score releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter
    associated with pleasure and satisfaction. This can create a cycle
    where I turn to games to experience that feeling of accomplishment
    and reward, especially when it\'s lacking in other areas of my life.

-   **Social Connectivity**: For many, online gaming is not just about
    the game but the community it provides. Engaging with like-minded
    players, especially when feeling isolated or lonely, can offer a
    sense of belonging and camaraderie.

-   **Routine and Habit**: Over time, gaming can become a deeply
    ingrained habit. Whenever there\'s a free moment or a stressful
    situation, my instinct might be to turn to games, as it has become a
    default coping mechanism.

-   **Lack of Alternative Coping Strategies**: If I haven\'t developed
    other means to manage stress, boredom, or other emotions, I might
    naturally revert to gaming, as it\'s a familiar and previously
    effective method.

## I can stop gaming if I\'m traveling

Traveling diverts my attention, and in traveling I have succeeded in not
gaming. But when facing loads of work and studying, I would often go
back to gaming all over again.

## Gaming Itself

Although gaming has all the cons, reasons are needed on why gaming is
bad.

Some invalid reasons include

-   The teacher forbids me from gaming Teachers are usually not very
    smart people in tech. For example, (most) teachers don\'t know how
    to code. (Most) Teachers don\'t know how to use linux. (Most)
    Teachers don\'t know computer networking. (Most) Teachers don\'t
    know html. (Most) Teachers don\'t know computer security. Trusting
    the teacher who has limited knowledge in tech and is arrogant is
    stupid.
-   Parents forbid me from gaming Same as above
-   Gaming shifts your attention from studying Everything shifts my
    attention, including studying foreign languages, planning and taking
    long walks. Just because gaming shifts my attention doesn\'t mean I
    need to quit gaming
-   People who game don\'t study well People in top universities with
    top scores sometimes game a lot.

Some valid reasons include

-   **I gain nothing from gaming** After running I run faster, after
    studying I know more, after learning language I learn more about
    culture. However, after gaming I get nothing.
-   **Time consuming** Gaming is addictive, and I usually spend more
    time than intended.
-   **Mental Health Impacts** Becoming too immersed in a game can lead
    to heightened emotions and loss of control, exacerbating feelings of
    distress or agitation.
-   **Social Isolation** While gaming can offer a virtual community, it
    might also mean less time spent with family or friends in the real
    world, leading to feelings of isolation or neglecting important
    relationships.

However, I must also acknowledge painfully that pros of gaming exists

-   Gaming is exciting and life is boring
-   Gaming is escape when facing stress
-   Gaming includes online conversation, which I might want when feeling
    lonely
-   Gaming moves may seem cool and accomplishing

## The essay I wrote before {#whats-next}

## What\'s next? {#whats-nedfdxt}

I gamed for more than 600 hours in the past year, that is the equivalent
of losing one half month. I can do so much in one half month (without
taking into account the fact that when I was gaming I was more tired
than usual).

I run out of motivation lately. I couldn\'t stop myself from gaming
lately. Every time I tried to stop gaming, gaming dominated my life even
more.

What should I do next?

Updates\
I stopped gaming at October 15th, and it\'s been one month without
gaming at all. It has been very hard, and I faced mental challenges. I
hope I can stay away from gaming forever.
